{"xiamen24":{"100m Men":{"tiebreaker":"9.85","date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Predicted Finish and Times:**\n\n1. Christian Coleman (USA) - 9.82 seconds\n2. Fred Kerley (USA) - 9.88 seconds\n3. Ackeem Blake (JAM) - 9.93 seconds\n4. Brandon Carnes (USA) - 9.99 seconds\n5. Yohan Blake (JAM) - 10.02 seconds\n6. Emmanuel Eseme (CMR) - 10.05 seconds\n7. Ryiem Forde (JAM) - 10.09 seconds\n8. Rohan Watson (JAM) - 10.12 seconds\n9. Yoshihide Kiryu (JPN) - 10.15 seconds\n10. Xinrui Deng (CHN) - 10.25 seconds\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Christian Coleman** is predicted to win due to his consistent performance near or below the 9.90-second mark, including a recent time of 9.83 seconds in both Xiamen and at Hayward Field, showcasing his top-tier speed and reliability in big moments. His status as the 2019 world champion and world indoor record holder for the 60 meters demonstrates his explosive start and acceleration, crucial in the 100 meters.\n\n2. **Fred Kerley** has shown remarkable versatility and speed, transitioning from the 400 meters to sprint events successfully. His 2022 100m gold at the world championship and a 9.88-second performance in Yokohama indicate he's a real contender. However, being slightly behind Coleman's best times places him in second.\n\n3. **Ackeem Blake**, a younger talent with a lot to prove, has shown promise with times like 9.93 seconds in New York, suggesting he's on the cusp of breaking into the top tier. His recent performances, including a 10.25-second finish in April, show he's in competitive form, albeit not quite at the level of Coleman or Kerley.\n\n4. **Brandon Carnes** has shown consistent sub-10.10 performances and a notable 10.02-second finish in Nashville. While impressive, these times do not consistently challenge the top three, positioning him as a strong contender but not the favorite.\n\n5. **Yohan Blake**, despite being the second fastest man ever in both the 100m and 200m, has seen a decline in his peak performance levels. Recent times around the low 10-seconds (e.g., 10.01 seconds in Monaco) suggest he remains competitive but may struggle to recapture his best form against younger rivals.\n\n6. **Emmanuel Eseme** has shown significant improvement and consistency, with a personal best of 9.96 seconds. However, his times are not quite at the level of the top contenders in this field, placing him in the middle of the pack.\n\n7. **Ryiem Forde** is a promising young talent with a recent sub-10 performance (9.95 seconds in Budapest), indicating potential but lacking the consistency and experience of the top competitors.\n\n8. **Rohan Watson** has shown he can dip under the 10-second barrier with a 9.91-second performance in Kingston. However, his inconsistency at major meets suggests he might not be ready to challenge for the top spots in this race.\n\n9. **Yoshihide Kiryu** has a personal best of 10.01 seconds, tying the World junior record, but recent performances suggest he's not in his prime form to compete with the fastest in this field.\n\n10. **Xinrui Deng** is the youngest and relatively inexperienced at the international level. His best of 10.21 seconds shows promise, but it's unlikely he'll challenge the established names in this race.\n\nThe predictions are based on the athletes' recent performances, their historical best times, and the trajectory of their careers. Christian Coleman's current form and pedigree make him the favorite, with Fred Kerley and Ackeem Blake challenging strongly. Veterans like Yohan Blake may find it challenging to reclaim their top spots against rising stars and those in peak form.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Blake","id":"14201842","pb":"9.69","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Coleman","id":"14541956","pb":"9.76","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Kerley","id":"14504382","pb":"9.76","sb":"10.03","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ackeem","lastName":"Blake","id":"14638971","pb":"9.89","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Watson","id":"14779154","pb":"9.91","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ryiem","lastName":"Forde","id":"14779152","pb":"9.95","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Eseme","id":"14852717","pb":"9.96","sb":"10.14","nat":"CMR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Yoshihide","lastName":"Kiryu","id":"14547456","pb":"9.98","sb":null,"nat":"JPN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Carnes","id":"14466007","pb":"10.01","sb":"10.27","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Xinrui","lastName":"Deng","id":"15074892","pb":"10.21","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"10.13","place":1,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Coleman","id":"14541956","pb":"9.76","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.17","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Kerley","id":"14504382","pb":"9.76","sb":"10.03","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.20","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Ackeem","lastName":"Blake","id":"14638971","pb":"9.89","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.27","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Watson","id":"14779154","pb":"9.91","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.31","place":5,"notes":""},{"mark":"10.33","place":6,"notes":""},{"mark":"10.38","place":7,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Yoshihide","lastName":"Kiryu","id":"14547456","pb":"9.98","sb":null,"nat":"JPN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.40","place":8,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Carnes","id":"14466007","pb":"10.01","sb":"10.27","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.43","place":9,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Yohan","lastName":"Blake","id":"14201842","pb":"9.69","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"10.55","place":10,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Xinrui","lastName":"Deng","id":"15074892","pb":"10.21","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}}]},"800m Men":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"### Predicted Finish and Marks\n\n1. Marco Arop (CAN) - 1:42.75\n2. Wyclife Kinyamal (KEN) - 1:43.05\n3. Alex Ngeno Kipngetich (KEN) - 1:43.90\n4. Clayton Murphy (USA) - 1:44.20\n5. Andreas Kramer (SWE) - 1:44.50\n6. Abdelati el Guesse (MAR) - 1:44.70\n7. Tshepiso Masalela (BOT) - 1:44.95\n8. Elias Ngeny (KEN) - 1:45.10\n9. Mark English (IRL) - 1:45.50\n10. Dezhu Liu (CHN) - 1:46.20\n11. Ethan Hussey (GBR) - 1:46.50\n12. Patryk Sieradzki (POL) - 1:47.00\n\n### Reasoning\n\n**Marco Arop** is positioned as the favorite due to his consistent performance near the 1:42 - 1:43 mark, including a national record of 1:42.85 and a recent win with a time of 1:42.85 at Hayward Field. His status as the reigning world champion in the 800m and his series of first-place finishes in 2023 lend credibility to the prediction of a winning time of 1:42.75.\n\n**Wyclife Kinyamal** has shown excellent form, especially with his 1:43.22 win in Monaco and a personal best close to that mark. His gold medal at the 2018 Commonwealth Games and a consistent performance around the 1:43 - 1:44 range make him a strong contender for the second position.\n\n**Alex Ngeno Kipngetich**, despite being young, has shown significant potential with times close to 1:44, including a 1:44.07 performance recently. His upward trajectory and competitive times in Nairobi hint at his capability to challenge the leaders.\n\n**Clayton Murphy**, a 2016 Olympic bronze medalist, has a well-established career with times consistently in the mid-1:44s. However, his recent performance hasn't been as strong as Arop's or Kinyamal's, positioning him in fourth.\n\n**Andreas Kramer** has been impressive in indoor competitions and shown he can compete at a high level with a silver medal at the 2024 World Indoor Championships. His best of 1:44.85 in Paris places him in the middle of the pack.\n\n**Abdelati el Guesse** has consistently performed well with times in the low 1:45s, including a recent 1:44.52. His experience and capacity to perform in clutch situations justify a competitive finish.\n\n**Tshepiso Masalela** has been a strong competitor, especially with a 1:44.14 performance in Budapest. However, his inconsistency places him slightly behind the leading group.\n\n**Elias Ngeny** and **Mark English** are positioned further back due to their slightly slower times in recent competitions compared to the leaders, but they remain competitive in the middle-distance running field.\n\n**Dezhu Liu**, **Ethan Hussey**, and **Patryk Sieradzki** round out the predictions. Liu's national record and performance in Asian competitions show promise, but he lacks the experience at the global level compared to competitors. Hussey, a young talent with a bright future, and Sieradzki, who has been inconsistent with several DNFs, are predicted to finish in the latter positions due to their lesser experience and exposure to high-competition environments like this one.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Arop","id":"14755875","pb":"1:42.85","sb":null,"nat":"CAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Clayton","lastName":"Murphy","id":"14536714","pb":"1:42.93","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wyclife","lastName":"Kinyamal","id":"14746603","pb":"1:43.12","sb":"1:44.52","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Ngeny","id":"14849580","pb":"1:43.84","sb":"1:44.79","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tshepiso","lastName":"Masalela","id":"14754326","pb":"1:44.03","sb":null,"nat":"BOT","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Alex Ngeno","lastName":"Kipngetich","id":"14798146","pb":"1:44.07","sb":"1:44.07","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kramer","id":"14538207","pb":"1:44.47","sb":null,"nat":"SWE","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Abdelati","lastName":"el Guesse","id":"14652586","pb":"1:44.52","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"English","id":"14377494","pb":"1:44.71","sb":null,"nat":"IRL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ethan","lastName":"Hussey","id":"14815377","pb":"1:44.96","sb":null,"nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Sieradzki","id":"14647295","pb":"1:45.13","sb":"1:48.90","nat":"POL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Dezhu","lastName":"Liu","id":"14811434","pb":"1:46.77","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"1:43.61","place":1,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Arop","id":"14755875","pb":"1:42.85","sb":null,"nat":"CAN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:43.66","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Wyclife","lastName":"Kinyamal","id":"14746603","pb":"1:43.12","sb":"1:44.52","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:43.88","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Tshepiso","lastName":"Masalela","id":"14754326","pb":"1:44.03","sb":null,"nat":"BOT","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:44.76","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Alex Ngeno","lastName":"Kipngetich","id":"14798146","pb":"1:44.07","sb":"1:44.07","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:44.81","place":5,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kramer","id":"14538207","pb":"1:44.47","sb":null,"nat":"SWE","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:45.37","place":6,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Ngeny","id":"14849580","pb":"1:43.84","sb":"1:44.79","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:45.38","place":7,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Clayton","lastName":"Murphy","id":"14536714","pb":"1:42.93","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:45.65","place":8,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Abdelati","lastName":"el Guesse","id":"14652586","pb":"1:44.52","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:45.66","place":9,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Dezhu","lastName":"Liu","id":"14811434","pb":"1:46.77","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:46.20","place":10,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Ethan","lastName":"Hussey","id":"14815377","pb":"1:44.96","sb":null,"nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"1:47.02","place":11,"notes":""},{"mark":"1:47.14","place":12,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"English","id":"14377494","pb":"1:44.71","sb":null,"nat":"IRL","hasAvy":true}},{"place":null,"notes":"DNF","entrant":{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Sieradzki","id":"14647295","pb":"1:45.13","sb":"1:48.90","nat":"POL","hasAvy":true}}]},"5000m Men":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"### Predicted Finish and Times for Men's 5000 Metres\n\n1. **Lamecha Girma (ETH)** - 12:47.50\n2. **Telahun Haile Bekele (ETH)** - 12:48.90\n3. **Nicholas Kipkorir (KEN)** - 12:51.00\n4. **Birhanu Balew (BRN)** - 12:52.00\n5. **Ishmael Rokitto Kipkurui (KEN)** - 12:56.00\n6. **Cornelius Kemboi (KEN)** - 12:58.00\n7. **Brian Fay (IRL)** - 13:00.00\n8. **Nibret Melak (ETH)** - 13:02.00\n9. **Benson Kiplangat (KEN)** - 13:04.00\n10. **Oscar Chelimo (UGA)** - 13:05.00\n11. **Stewart McSweyn (AUS)** - 13:08.00\n12. **Addisu Yihune (ETH)** - 13:10.00\n13. **Isaac Kimeli (BEL)** - 13:12.00\n14. **Mohamed Abdilaahi (GER)** - 13:14.00\n15. **Egide Ntakarutimana (BDI)** - 13:16.00\n16. **Kuma Girma (ETH)** - 13:18.00\n17. **Ronald Kwemoi (KEN)** - 13:20.00\n18. **Matthew Ramsden (AUS)** - 13:22.00\n19. **Jack Rayner (AUS)** - 13:25.00\n20. **Dan Kibet (UGA)** - 13:27.00\n21. **Sam Parsons (GER)** - 13:30.00\n22. **Callum Davies (AUS)** - 13:35.00\n23. **Mounir Akbache (FRA)** - DNF\n\n### Reasoning\n\n**Lamecha Girma** is placed first due to his extraordinary performances and consistency at the top level. His world record in the 3000 metres steeplechase and his indoor record for 3000 metres highlight his exceptional speed and endurance. Given his form, a time of 12:47.50 is within reach.\n\n**Telahun Haile Bekele** follows closely, with impressive 5000 metres times throughout 2023, indicating he's in prime shape to challenge Girma. His 12:42.70 in Monaco is a standout result that suggests he's capable of a 12:48.90 here.\n\n**Nicholas Kipkorir** has shown versatility across distances, and his sub-13 minute personal best in the 5000m from previous years places him as a strong contender, predicted to finish in 12:51.00, leveraging his endurance from longer road races.\n\n**Birhanu Balew** has demonstrated his capability in the 5000m with times consistently around the low 13-minute mark. A potential 12:52.00 reflects his upward trajectory and competitive history.\n\n**Ishmael Rokitto Kipkurui**, despite his young age, has shown promise with a fast 13:05.67 in 5000m and victory in cross country, indicating potential for a 12:56.00 finish in a strong field.\n\n**Cornelius Kemboi** and **Brian Fay** have been competitive with sub-13:25 performances. Given their progression, times around 12:58.00 and 13:00.00, respectively, are within reach.\n\n**Nibret Melak's** half marathon and 10,000m performances suggest strong endurance, which could translate to a solid 13:02.00 in the 5000m, despite less focus on this distance.\n\n**Benson Kiplangat** and **Oscar Chelimo** have shown potential in the 5000m and across other distances, predicting them to finish in the low 13-minute range.\n\n**Stewart McSweyn** has been included due to his broad range across middle distances but his recent performances suggest a 13:08.00 finish as he transitions back to peak form in longer distances.\n\n**Addisu Yihune**'s youth and victories indicate a bright future, with a predicted time of 13:10.00 reflecting his growing experience on the international stage.\n\n**Isaac Kimeli, Mohamed Abdilaahi,** and the rest down to **Dan Kibet** have shown competencies in the 5000m, but in this hypothetical elite field, they would likely finish in the mid to high 13-minute range due to the depth of talent and their own recent performances.\n\n**Sam Parsons**, **Callum Davies**, and **Mounir Akbache** are predicted lower due to less competitive times in the 5000m or focusing on shorter distances, with Akbache predicted to not finish (DNF) due to a series of DNFs in recent competitions, suggesting possible issues with form or fitness at this distance.\n\nThis prediction takes into account each athlete's recent performances, their progression over time, and how their strengths across various distances might translate into a competitive 5000m race.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Telahun

Hansle Parchment (JAM) - 12.95\n2. Daniel Roberts (USA) - 13.00\n3. Shunsuke Izumiya (JPN) - 13.02\n4. Wilhem Belocian (FRA) - 13.10\n5. Cordell Tinch (USA) - 13.15\n6. Freddie Crittenden (USA) - 13.17\n7. Jamal Britt (USA) - 13.20\n8. Eric Edwards (USA) - 13.25\n9. Orlando Bennett (JAM) - 13.30\n10. Junxi Liu (CHN) - 13.45\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Hansle Parchment** is the reigning Olympic champion and has shown consistent performance with a recent best of 12.93. His experience and ability to perform under pressure make him the top contender. His victory in Eugene with a time of 12.93 (+0.9) underscores his top form and readiness for big meets.\n\n2. **Daniel Roberts** has been performing exceptionally well with a season's best close to Parchment's, clocking 13.01. His consistent sub-13.10 performances and a bronze medal at the 2023 World Championships indicate he's in prime position to challenge for the top spot, but Parchment's experience might just edge him out.\n\n3. **Shunsuke Izumiya** has shown great potential and improvement, with a personal best of 13.04 set this season. His upward trajectory and ability to compete at a high level, shown by his performances in Japan and internationally, make him a strong candidate for a top-three finish.\n\n4. **Wilhem Belocian** has been a steady performer, with times consistently around the low 13.20s and even dipping into the high 13.0s. His experience on the European circuit and ability to perform well in various conditions place him just behind the top contenders.\n\n5. **Cordell Tinch** shows promise with his best of 12.96, but his recent performances have been a mix, with times ranging from the low to mid-13s. His inconsistency, especially in high-stake meets, might see him struggling to keep up with the top four.\n\n6. **Freddie Crittenden** has shown he can perform well, being a silver medalist at the Pan American Games. However, his season's best places him slightly behind the others in this highly competitive field.\n\n7. **Jamal Britt** has had moments of brilliance, such as a 12.99 performance, but his inconsistency in major meets might hinder his ability to crack into the top five against a field of this caliber.\n\n8. **Eric Edwards** has shown he is capable of competing at a high level with performances in the low 13.20s. However, the depth of talent in this field might make it difficult for him to ascend any higher in the rankings.\n\n9. **Orlando Bennett**, despite showing potential with times in the low 13.20s, his performances haven't quite reached the level of the top contenders in this prediction, placing him towards the latter part of the list.\n\n10. **Junxi Liu** is the youngest and perhaps the least experienced at this level of competition. Despite showing promise with times in the low 13.40s, competing against a field with multiple sub-13.10 performers might prove a tall order.\n\nThis prediction takes into account not only the athletes' best times but also their recent form, consistency, and experience in high-pressure situations, which are crucial in a highly competitive and unpredictable event like the men's 110 meters hurdles.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Hansle","lastName":"Parchment","id":"14325570","pb":"12.93","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Cordell","lastName":"Tinch","id":"14719972","pb":"12.96","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Freddie","lastName":"Crittenden","id":"14491556","pb":"13.00","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Roberts","id":"14577558","pb":"13.00","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Izumiya","id":"14815041","pb":"13.04","sb":null,"nat":"JPN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wilhem","lastName":"Belocian","id":"14462837","pb":"13.07","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Britt","id":"14769264","pb":"13.08","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Edwards","id":"14716336","pb":"13.15","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Orlando","lastName":"Bennett","id":"14739873","pb":"13.18","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Junxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"14977766","pb":"13.40","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"13.11","place":1,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Roberts","id":"14577558","pb":"13.00","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.16","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Cordell","lastName":"Tinch","id":"14719972","pb":"12.96","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.17","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Izumiya","id":"14815041","pb":"13.04","sb":null,"nat":"JPN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.30","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Freddie","lastName":"Crittenden","id":"14491556","pb":"13.00","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.31","place":5,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Edwards","id":"14716336","pb":"13.15","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.33","place":6,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Hansle","lastName":"Parchment","id":"14325570","pb":"12.93","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.48","place":7,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Junxi","lastName":"Liu","id":"14977766","pb":"13.40","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.58","place":8,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Orlando","lastName":"Bennett","id":"14739873","pb":"13.18","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.88","place":9,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Britt","id":"14769264","pb":"13.08","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}}]},"200m Women":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Predicted Finish and Marks for the Women's 200 Metres:**\n\n1. Sha'Carri Richardson (USA) - 21.89\n2. Twanisha Terry (USA) - 22.15\n3. Tamara Clark (USA) - 22.30\n4. Anthonique Strachan (BAH) - 22.35\n5. Veronica Shanti Pereira (SGP) - 22.70\n6. Kayla White (USA) - 22.75\n7. Anavia Battle (USA) - 22.80\n8. Caisja Chandler (USA) - 22.85\n9. Mujinga Kambundji (SUI) - 22.90\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Sha'Carri Richardson** has consistently shown that she is one of the fastest women in the world over both 100m and 200m. Her previous performances, like the 21.61* (+2.6) in 200 Metres at Hayward Field, despite being wind-aided, show her incredible speed. Given her trajectory and improvements over time, a predicted time of 21.89 seems reasonable and places her at the top of this list.\n\n2. **Twanisha Terry** has been a strong contender, especially with her performance in the 200 Metres at Hayward Field, recording a time of 22.38. Terry has shown she can compete at a high level, and her consistency in both the 100m and 200m makes her a strong candidate for the second spot.\n\n3. **Tamara Clark** has shown significant improvement and competitiveness across a range of sprint events. Her first-place finish at Hayward Field in the 200 Metres with a time of 22.05 (+0.2) is notable. Given the caliber of competition, predicting her to finish third with a slight improvement is reasonable.\n\n4. **Anthonique Strachan** from the Bahamas has put up competitive times in the 200m, such as her third place at Monaco with a time of 22.40 (+0.2). Her experience and consistent performance make her a strong contender for the fourth spot.\n\n5. **Veronica Shanti Pereira** has been a standout athlete for Singapore, setting multiple national records. While her best time of 22.57 is remarkable, the depth of the field in this prediction places her in the fifth spot. Her trajectory suggests she could improve, but the competition is fierce.\n\n6. **Kayla White** has shown promise with her performances, notably a third-place finish in the 200 Metres at Hayward Field with a time of 22.01 (-0.4). However, given the depth of talent in this field, she's predicted to finish sixth.\n\n7. **Anavia Battle** has demonstrated her capabilities, especially with her third-place finish in the 200m at the US Olympic trials. Despite her talent, the competition level in this prediction places her seventh.\n\n8. **Caisja Chandler** has had notable performances, but in this strong field, she is predicted to finish eighth. Her best times are competitive, but the transition to facing a field of this caliber might see her finishing with a time of 22.85.\n\n9. **Mujinga Kambundji**, despite being a seasoned and accomplished sprinter, especially in the 60m, might find the 200m in this field challenging. Her experience is vast, but the younger athletes' speed might edge her out to the ninth place in this prediction.\n\nThis prediction takes into account the recent performances, personal bests, and competitive history of each athlete. While the times are estimated and might not reflect the exact outcomes due to variables like weather conditions, track surface, and race day form, they provide a reasonable expectation based on available data and the athletes' progression.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Clark","id":"14596381","pb":"21.92","sb":"22.21","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Sha'Carri","lastName":"Richardson","id":"14717691","pb":"21.92","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Anavia","lastName":"Battle","id":"14715397","pb":"21.95","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Kayla","lastName":"White","id":"14642681","pb":"22.01","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true,"team":"North Carolina A&T Aggies"},{"firstName":"Mujinga","lastName":"Kambundji","id":"14300897","pb":"22.05","sb":null,"nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Anthonique","lastName":"Strachan","id":"14368117","pb":"22.15","sb":null,"nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Twanisha","lastName":"Terry","id":"14553598","pb":"22.17","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Caisja","lastName":"Chandler","id":"14731976","pb":"22.37","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Veronica Shanti","lastName":"Pereira","id":"14472153","pb":"22.57","sb":null,"nat":"SGP","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"22.96","place":1,"notes":""},{"mark":"22.99","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Sha'Carri","lastName":"Richardson","id":"14717691","pb":"21.92","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"23.01","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Clark","id":"14596381","pb":"21.92","sb":"22.21","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"23.02","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Anavia","lastName":"Battle","id":"14715397","pb":"21.95","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"23.25","place":5,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Twanisha","lastName":"Terry","id":"14553598","pb":"22.17","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"23.39","place":6,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Mujinga","lastName":"Kambundji","id":"14300897","pb":"22.05","sb":null,"nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"23.65","place":7,"notes":""},{"mark":"23.72","place":8,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Caisja","lastName":"Chandler","id":"14731976","pb":"22.37","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"24.21","place":9,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Anthonique","lastName":"Strachan","id":"14368117","pb":"22.15","sb":null,"nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true}}]},"400m Women":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"### Predicted Finish and Times\n\n1. **Marileidy Paulino (DOM) - 48.70**\n2. **Natalia Kaczmarek (POL) - 49.30**\n3. **Sada Williams (BAR) - 49.50**\n4. **Britton Wilson (USA) - 49.80**\n5. **Stephenie Ann McPherson (JAM) - 50.40**\n6. **Alexis Holmes (USA) - 50.60**\n7. **Lynna Irby-Jackson (USA) - 50.80**\n8. **Aliyah Abrams (GUY) - 51.10**\n9. **Makenzie Dunmore (USA) - 51.30**\n\n### Reasoning\n\n**Marileidy Paulino** takes the top spot with a predicted time of 48.70. Her consistent sub-50 performances throughout the year, including a standout time of 48.76 in August 2023, place her in a strong position. As the world's No. 1 ranked 400m runner since May 2023 and with a history of breaking the 49-second barrier multiple times this season, Paulino's dominance is clear. Her silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and the 2022 World Athletics Championships underline her high-stakes competition pedigree.\n\n**Natalia Kaczmarek** is predicted to finish second with a time of 49.30, based on her impressive sub-50 performance in July 2023 of 49.48 and consistent performances around the 50-second mark throughout the year. Her silver medal at the 2022 European Championships and her role in Poland's gold-winning mixed 4x400m relay team at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics demonstrate her competitive edge and experience on the international stage.\n\n**Sada Williams** is slated for third with a predicted time of 49.50. Her bronze medal at the 2022 World Championships and gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games, along with a personal best of 49.75, showcase her potential to challenge the leaders. Williams' consistent sub-50 performances, including a 49.58 in August 2023, make her a strong contender.\n\n**Britton Wilson**, with a predicted finish time of 49.80, has shown exceptional talent, especially with her indoor 400m North American record of 49.48 in March 2023. Though primarily a 400m hurdler, her flat 400m times are competitive, but she might find it challenging to surpass athletes who specialize more exclusively in the 400m flat.\n\n**Stephenie Ann McPherson** comes next with a time of 50.40. Despite being the most experienced among the competitors, her recent performances suggest she might not be able to reach the podium against this field. However, her extensive experience in World Championships and Olympics finals could help her secure a respectable finish.\n\n**Alexis Holmes** is predicted to post a time of 50.60. Her recent performances, including a 50.34 indoor in February 2024, indicate she is in form, but she might lack the experience at the very top level compared to the leaders of this field.\n\n**Lynna Irby-Jackson**, with a predicted time of 50.80, has shown versatility across sprinting events. Despite her impressive junior achievements and solid performances, she has not quite reached the elite times of the top contenders in this field.\n\n**Aliyah Abrams** is expected to finish with a time of 51.10. While she has shown potential, her times in 2023 and into 2024 have generally been in the low 51s, indicating she might struggle to keep up with the faster pace of this race.\n\n**Makenzie Dunmore** is predicted to round out the field with a time of 51.30. Despite her NCAA success and relay performances, her individual 400m times have not been as competitive as her peers in this prediction.\n\nThis prediction takes into account the athletes' recent performances, their career-best times, and their experience in international competitions. However, track and field can always surprise us, and any of these athletes could potentially outperform expectations on the day of the race.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Marileidy","lastName":"Paulino","id":"14749613","pb":"48.76","sb":null,"nat":"DOM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Britton","lastName":"Wilson","id":"14716862","pb":"49.13","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Stephenie Ann","lastName":"McPherson","id":"14285809","pb":"49.34","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Natalia","lastName":"Kaczmarek","id":"14642563","pb":"49.48","sb":null,"nat":"POL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Sada","lastName":"Williams","id":"14592846","pb":"49.58","sb":"51.93","nat":"BAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lynna","lastName":"Irby-Jackson","id":"14486888","pb":"49.80","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Aliyah","lastName":"Abrams","id":"14447688","pb":"50.20","sb":null,"nat":"GUY","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Alexis","lastName":"Holmes","id":"14761424","pb":"50.32","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Makenzie","lastName":"Dunmore","id":"14536492","pb":"50.35","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"50.08","place":1,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Marileidy","lastName":"Paulino","id":"14749613","pb":"48.76","sb":null,"nat":"DOM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"50.29","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Natalia","lastName":"Kaczmarek","id":"14642563","pb":"49.48","sb":null,"nat":"POL","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"51.26","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Britton","lastName":"Wilson","id":"14716862","pb":"49.13","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"51.97","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Sada","lastName":"Williams","id":"14592846","pb":"49.58","sb":"51.93","nat":"BAR","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"52.36","place":5,"notes":""},{"mark":"52.47","place":6,"notes":""},{"mark":"52.69","place":7,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Aliyah","lastName":"Abrams","id":"14447688","pb":"50.20","sb":null,"nat":"GUY","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"52.97","place":8,"notes":""},{"mark":"53.65","place":9,"notes":""}]},"1500m Women":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Predicted Finish and Times for the Women's 1500 Metres:**\n\n1.

Her experience at the highest level, including Olympic and World Championship golds, sets her apart as the clear favorite.\n\n- **Gudaf Tsegay** has shown exceptional form, holding the world record for the 5000 metres and demonstrating her versatility across distances. Her recent performances suggest she has the strength and speed to challenge for the top spots.\n\n- **Diribe Welteji**, despite her youth, has shown incredible promise with consistent performances and a silver medal at the 2023 World Championships. Her trajectory suggests she's on the brink of breaking into the very top tier.\n\n- **Freweyni Hailu** has shown impressive performances, including gold at the 2024 World Athletics Indoor Championships. Her recent form and competitive edge in both indoor and outdoor tracks position her as a strong contender.\n\n- **Sifan Hassan, Laura Muir, Jessica Hull, Gabriela DeBues-Stafford,** and **Linden Hall** are all experienced athletes with proven track records. They have consistently performed at a high level, and their experience in major competitions will serve them well. However, they may find it challenging to surpass the top three given their recent form and achievements.\n\n- **Winnie Nanyondo, Axumawit Embaye, Addison Wiley,** and **Tigist Girma** show potential but have been less consistent compared to the leaders. They will likely compete fiercely for the middle positions.\n\n- **Claudia Mihaela Bobocea, Gaia Sabbatini, Habitam Alemu,** and **Chunyu Wang** have shown talent in their respective specialties but might find the depth of competition in this field a significant challenge, placing them towards the end of the field.\n\nThis prediction takes into account recent performances, world rankings, competition experience, and potential for improvement. However, athletics is unpredictable, and any race can bring surprises.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Faith","lastName":"Kipyegon","id":"14413305","pb":"3:49.11","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Diribe","lastName":"Welteji","id":"14848719","pb":"3:53.93","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Gudaf","lastName":"Tsegay","id":"14595214","pb":"3:54.01","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Birke","lastName":"Haylom","id":"15009582","pb":"3:54.93","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Freweyni","lastName":"Hailu","id":"14836656","pb":"3:55.68","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Linden","lastName":"Hall","id":"14272002","pb":"3:56.92","sb":"4:05.41","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Worknesh","lastName":"Mesele","id":"14852703","pb":"3:57.00","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Axumawit","lastName":"Embaye","id":"14534819","pb":"3:58.80","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Addison","lastName":"Wiley","id":"14907337","pb":"3:59.17","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tigist","lastName":"Girma","id":"14894776","pb":"3:59.33","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Winnie","lastName":"Nanyondo","id":"14534257","pb":"3:59.56","sb":null,"nat":"UGA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Griffith","id":"14549778","pb":"4:00.16","sb":null,"nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Saron","lastName":"Berhe","id":"15009577","pb":"4:00.46","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Claudia Mihaela","lastName":"Bobocea","id":"14377909","pb":"4:01.10","sb":null,"nat":"ROU","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Gaia","lastName":"Sabbatini","id":"14682711","pb":"4:01.24","sb":null,"nat":"ITA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Habitam","lastName":"Alemu","id":"14730994","pb":"4:01.41","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Chunyu","lastName":"Wang","id":"14462001","pb":"4:11.42","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"3:50.30","place":1,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Gudaf","lastName":"Tsegay","id":"14595214","pb":"3:54.01","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:53.22","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Birke","lastName":"Haylom","id":"15009582","pb":"3:54.93","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:57.61","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Worknesh","lastName":"Mesele","id":"14852703","pb":"3:57.00","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:57.62","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Diribe","lastName":"Welteji","id":"14848719","pb":"3:53.93","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:58.18","place":5,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Freweyni","lastName":"Hailu","id":"14836656","pb":"3:55.68","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:59.04","place":6,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Georgia","lastName":"Griffith","id":"14549778","pb":"4:00.16","sb":null,"nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:59.06","place":7,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Habitam","lastName":"Alemu","id":"14730994","pb":"4:01.41","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:59.21","place":8,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Saron","lastName":"Berhe","id":"15009577","pb":"4:00.46","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"3:59.59","place":9,"notes":""},{"mark":"4:00.71","place":10,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Linden","lastName":"Hall","id":"14272002","pb":"3:56.92","sb":"4:05.41","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"4:03.45","place":11,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Addison","lastName":"Wiley","id":"14907337","pb":"3:59.17","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"4:04.94","place":12,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Axumawit","lastName":"Embaye","id":"14534819","pb":"3:58.80","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"4:06.09","place":13,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Winnie","lastName":"Nanyondo","id":"14534257","pb":"3:59.56","sb":null,"nat":"UGA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"4:08.90","place":14,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Gaia","lastName":"Sabbatini","id":"14682711","pb":"4:01.24","sb":null,"nat":"ITA","hasAvy":true}},{"place":null,"notes":"DNF"},{"place":null,"notes":"DNF"}]},"100m Hurdles Women":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"### Predicted Finish and Times:\n\n1. Tobi Amusan (NGR) - 12.29\n2. Jasmine Camacho-Quinn (PUR) - 12.34\n3. Danielle Williams (JAM) - 12.42\n4. Cyréna Samba-Mayela (FRA) - 12.45\n5. Alaysha Johnson (USA) - 12.47\n6. Devynne Charlton (BAH) - 12.51\n7. Masai Russell (USA) - 12.55\n8. Megan Tapper (JAM) - 12.58\n9. Ditaji Kambundji (SUI) - 12.64\n10. Yanni Wu (CHN) - 12.76\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n1. **Tobi Amusan** is placed first due to her consistent performance across the season, including setting the world record at 12.12 seconds and her impressive string of victories. Her ability to perform under pressure and consistently hit low 12-second times makes her the top contender. Her recent 12.33 performance at Hayward Field showcases she's in prime form.\n\n2. **Jasmine Camacho-Quinn** is a close second, with her Olympic record of 12.26 seconds and consistent sub-12.50 performances throughout the year. Her gold medal at Tokyo 2020 and recent performances, including a 12.38 second finish at Eugene, suggest she's in contention for the top spot but slightly behind Amusan based on current form.\n\n3. **Danielle Williams** is a seasoned competitor with a personal best of 12.32 seconds. Her history of championship-level performances, including gold at the 2015 World Championships and consistent finishes in the low 12-second range, positions her as a strong contender for a top finish.\n\n4. **Cyréna Samba-Mayela** has shown significant promise with a gold medal at the 2022 World Indoor Championships and a French national record of 7.73 seconds in the 60m hurdles. Her recent outdoor performances suggest she's transitioning well to the longer hurdle event.\n\n5. **Alaysha Johnson** has demonstrated her capabilities with a personal best of 12.35 seconds, placing her twelfth worldwide all-time in the 100m hurdles. Her recent win in Santiago with a time of 12.99 seconds in challenging conditions shows she's in competitive shape.\n\n6. **Devynne Charlton**'s consistent sub-12.50 performances and her strong showing at the Budapest meet, where she clocked 12.44 seconds, indicate she's in form to compete strongly in this field.\n\n7. **Masai Russell**'s notable performances, including a personal best of 12.36 seconds placing her 16th all-time, and her strong indoor season, suggest she's ready to challenge the leaders, though her outdoor times this season have been slightly off her best.\n\n8. **Megan Tapper**'s personal best of 12.53 seconds in Tokyo 2021 and her victory in Kingston with a time of 12.44 seconds show she's capable of competing at the highest levels, though her recent times have been a bit slower than the top contenders.\n\n9. **Ditaji Kambundji**'s recent performances, including a 12.68-second finish at Espoo, show she's improving and has the potential to challenge in major competitions, but she may find it challenging to break into the very top ranks in this field.\n\n10. **Yanni Wu**'s progress and victories within the Chinese national circuit, including a personal best of 12.93 seconds, show she's a strong hurdler. However, transitioning to international competition and facing a field with multiple sub-12.40 athletes could see her finishing towards the back of this elite group.\n\nThis prediction takes into account recent performances, personal bests, consistency, and the ability to perform under competition pressure.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Tobi","lastName":"Amusan","id":"14579526","pb":"12.12","sb":"12.89","nat":"NGR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jasmine","lastName":"Camacho-Quinn","id":"14494234","pb":"12.26","sb":null,"nat":"PUR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Danielle","lastName":"Williams","id":"14450995","pb":"12.32","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Alaysha","lastName":"Johnson","id":"14486620","pb":"12.35","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Masai","lastName":"Russell","id":"14659011","pb":"12.36","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Devynne","lastName":"Charlton","id":"14414505","pb":"12.44","sb":null,"nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Tapper","id":"14413569","pb":"12.44","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ditaji","lastName":"Kambundji","id":"14739461","pb":"12.47","sb":null,"nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Cyréna","lastName":"Samba-Mayela","id":"14735030","pb":"12.68","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Yanni","lastName":"Wu","id":"14585472","pb":"12.76","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}],"isClosed":true,"results":[{"mark":"12.45","place":1,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Jasmine","lastName":"Camacho-Quinn","id":"14494234","pb":"12.26","sb":null,"nat":"PUR","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.49","place":2,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Devynne","lastName":"Charlton","id":"14414505","pb":"12.44","sb":null,"nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.55","place":3,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Cyréna","lastName":"Samba-Mayela","id":"14735030","pb":"12.68","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.56","place":4,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Danielle","lastName":"Williams","id":"14450995","pb":"12.32","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.58","place":5,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Tobi","lastName":"Amusan","id":"14579526","pb":"12.12","sb":"12.89","nat":"NGR","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.67","place":6,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Masai","lastName":"Russell","id":"14659011","pb":"12.36","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.70","place":7,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Ditaji","lastName":"Kambundji","id":"14739461","pb":"12.47","sb":null,"nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"12.88","place":8,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Megan","lastName":"Tapper","id":"14413569","pb":"12.44","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.01","place":9,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Alaysha","lastName":"Johnson","id":"14486620","pb":"12.35","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}},{"mark":"13.04","place":10,"notes":"","entrant":{"firstName":"Yanni","lastName":"Wu","id":"14585472","pb":"12.76","sb":null,"nat":"CHN","hasAvy":true}}]},"3000m Steeplechase Women":{"date":"2024-04-20T00:00","url":"https://xiamen.diamondleague.com/program-results/program-2024/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Women's 3000 Metres Steeplechase Race Prediction:**\n\n1.

Aude Clavier (FRA) - 9:40.00\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n- **Winfred Mutile Yavi** is placed first with a predicted time of 8:48.90, slightly under her performance of 8:50.66 at Hayward Field, Eugene, OR (USA). Yavi's consistency at top-level competitions, such as her gold medal at the 2023 World Athletics Championships and her series of victories in 2023, indicates her rising form and potential to edge out even the world record holder, Beatrice Chepkoech.\n\n- **Beatrice Chepkoech** follows closely behind, predicted at 8:49.50. Despite holding the world record and showcasing a strong performance throughout the season, her recent second places against Yavi suggest a tight competition but ultimately second place in this hypothetical race.\n\n- **Jackline Chepkoech** and **Faith Cherotich** have shown exceptional performances and improvements, with Jackline having a victory in the Olympic Stadium, London (GBR) with a time of 8:57.35 and Faith consistently performing sub-9 minutes. Their youth and upward trajectory suggest they'll be serious contenders, but not quite ready to surpass Yavi and Beatrice.\n\n- **Sembo Almayew** and **Luiza Gega** show strong promise but are placed slightly lower due to the fierce competition and Gega's age possibly influencing her ability to hit peak performance compared to her younger counterparts.\n\n- **Peruth Chemutai**, the Olympic gold medalist, is placed seventh, acknowledging her previous Olympic success but considering her times have not been leading in the current field.\n\n- **Maruša Mišmaš Zrimšek** and the remaining athletes are placed based on their recent performances and times, with a consideration for their consistency and standout performances in the season.\n\n- **Madie Boreman**, **Regan Yee**, and **Aimee Pratt** show potential but have not reached the top tier times of the leaders in this field.\n\n- **Fancy Cherono**, **Cara Feain-Ryan**, **Adva Cohen**, **Shuangshuang Xu**, **Juliane Hvid**, and **Aude Clavier** are placed towards the bottom due to their times being further off the lead and less consistent performances at the highest levels of competition.\n\nThis prediction considers recent form,

athletes.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Beatrice","lastName":"Chepkoech","id":"14383286","pb":"8:44.32","sb":"9:15.61","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Winfred

Marileidy Paulino (DOM) - 48.70\n2. Sada Williams (BAR) - 49.50\n3. Britton Wilson (USA) - 49.80\n4. Talitha Diggs (USA) - 50.20\n5. Lynna Irby-Jackson (USA) - 50.50\n6. Stephenie Ann McPherson (JAM) - 51.00\n7. Aliyah Abrams (GUY) - 51.50\n8. Kaylin Whitney (USA) - 52.00\n\n### Reasoning:\n\n**Marileidy Paulino** has demonstrated consistent dominance in the 400m, particularly with her recent performance of 48.76 in Budapest, showcasing her as the top contender. Her status as the world No. 1 since May 2023 and her remarkable consistency at sub-50 second times make her the favorite. Her Olympic and World Championships pedigree, including a silver medal at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics and consistent first-place finishes in major meets throughout 2023, underscores her ability to perform under pressure.\n\n**Sada Williams** has also shown impressive performances, with her personal best and national record standing at 49.75, which she achieved in the 2022 season. The fact that she has frequently competed at sub-50 level, including a 49.58 finish in Budapest, positions her as a strong contender for the second spot. Her bronze medal at the 2022 World Championships further solidifies her capability to compete at the highest level.\n\n**Britton Wilson**, despite being a hurdles specialist, has shown incredible range with her North American indoor record in the 400m and significant performances outdoors. Her indoor time of 49.48 and her role in setting a mixed nationality women's team indoor record indicate her potential in flat 400m races. However, her slightly less consistent performance outdoors compared to Paulino and Williams places her in third.\n\n**Talitha Diggs** has demonstrated rapid improvement and versatility across sprint distances, with notable performances in both the 200m and 400m. Her youth and recent wins, including a significant time of 49.93 in Eugene, suggest she has the potential to challenge for a top spot, but her relative inexperience at international senior level compared to the top three predicts a fourth-place finish.\n\n**Lynna Irby-Jackson** has shown potential with sub-51 performances and her extensive background in sprinting from a young age. However, her performances, while competitive, have not quite reached the level of the athletes predicted to finish ahead of her.\n\n**Stephenie Ann McPherson** brings experience and a strong track record, including a bronze medal at the 2013 World Championships. However, her recent times have been slightly off her personal best, indicating she might not be in peak form for a top finish.\n\n**Aliyah Abrams** has shown she can perform well, especially with her 50.20 performance in the Bahamas, but her times have been more variable compared to the leading contenders. This variability, especially in more recent performances, places her towards the end of the predicted finishes.\n\n**Kaylin Whitney**, originally a sprinting prodigy, has transitioned to the 400m with competitive times. However, her recent performances, while solid, have not matched the top tier of 400m specialists in this field, leading to a prediction of finishing last among this group of elite athletes.\n\nThis prediction takes into account recent performances, the athletes' consistency, and their experience in major championships, balancing current form with proven ability to deliver in high-stakes competitions.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Haruna","lastName":"Kuboyama","nat":"JPN","pb":"53.07","sb":"53.90","hasAvy":true,"id":"14809386"},{"firstName":"Evelis","lastName":"Aguilar","nat":"COL","pb":"51.07","sb":"52.97","hasAvy":true,"id":"14369345"},{"firstName":"Kaylin","lastName":"Whitney","nat":"USA","pb":"50.29","sb":"52.36","hasAvy":true,"id":"14524719"},{"firstName":"Stephenie Ann","lastName":"Mcpherson","nat":"JAM","pb":"49.34","sb":"54.02","hasAvy":true,"id":"14285809"},{"firstName":"Talitha","lastName":"Diggs","nat":"USA","pb":"49.93","sb":"51.23","hasAvy":true,"id":"14773307"},{"firstName":"Marileidy","lastName":"Paulino","nat":"DOM","pb":"48.76","sb":"50.08","hasAvy":true,"id":"14749613"},{"firstName":"Sada","lastName":"Williams","nat":"BAR","pb":"49.58","sb":"51.93","hasAvy":true,"id":"14592846"},{"firstName":"Aliyah","lastName":"Abrams","nat":"GUY","pb":"50.20","sb":"51.93","hasAvy":true,"id":"14447688"}]},"100m Men":{"date":"2024-04-27T19:18","url":"https://shanghai.diamondleague.com/programme-results/programme-results-shanghai/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Predicted Finish and Times**\n\n1.

Brandon Carnes (USA) - 10.04\n8. Guanfeng Chen (CHN) - 10.12\n9. Yoshihide Kiryu (JPN) - 10.15\n\n**Reasoning**\n\n- **Christian Coleman** is placed first with a time of 9.80 due to his consistent performance sub-10 seconds, with his latest times showing he’s in top form (9.83 in both Xiamen and Eugene). His title as the 2019 world champion and his indoor 60m world record demonstrates his explosive start and ability to maintain top speed, crucial for the 100m.\n\n- **Fred Kerley** is predicted second with a time of 9.86. Transitioning from 400m to shorter sprints has only honed his performance, as evidenced by his 9.88 and 9.91 times in Yokohama and Rabat. His speed endurance from 400m days gives him an edge in the closing meters of the 100m.\n\n- **Ackeem Blake** is placed third at 9.89, reflecting his potential shown by sub-10 performances and a notable 9.89 win in Los Angeles. As a rising star, he has shown rapid improvement that could see him close the gap on more experienced competitors.\n\n- **Akani Simbine** is placed fourth with a time of 9.92. His consistent performance around the 9.9x mark, including a 9.97 win in Chorzów, shows he's a strong competitor. However, his times are slightly off the leaders, placing him just outside the top three.\n\n- **Yohan Blake**, with a predicted time of 9.95, is placed fifth. Despite being one of the fastest men in history, his recent performances suggest he is not at his peak form of past years. His experience and competitive nature could see him challenge the top spots, but younger athletes have shown faster times recently.\n\n- **Rohan Watson** is a young talent emerging on the scene, with a 9.91 performance in Kingston highlighting his potential. Predicted sixth with a time of 10.00, he may lack the experience at the moment to crack into the top five against a field of seasoned competitors.\n\n- **Brandon Carnes** is placed seventh with a predicted time of 10.04. He has shown capability with times close to the 10-second barrier, but he lacks the standout performances of the athletes ranked above him in this prediction.\n\n- **Guanfeng Chen** is eighth with a time of 10.12. While a strong contender in his national context and showing promise, his times have not yet reached the level of international competitiveness required to challenge the top spots in this field.\n\n- **Yoshihide Kiryu** is ninth at 10.15. Despite his historical performances and being a part of Japan's silver medal-winning relay team, his individual times have not been on par with the leading competitors in this prediction, placing him at the end of the list.\n\nThis prediction considers recent performances, historical bests, and the potential for improvement or decline. While all athletes have demonstrated exceptional talent, the slight differences in recent form, personal bests, and competitive experience have informed their predicted order and times.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Yoshihide","lastName":"Kiryu","nat":"JPN","pb":"9.98","sb":"10.38","hasAvy":true,"id":"14547456"},{"firstName":"Brandon","lastName":"Carnes","nat":"USA","pb":"10.01","sb":"10.27","hasAvy":true,"id":"14466007"},{"firstName":"Ackeem","lastName":"Blake","nat":"JAM","pb":"9.89","sb":"10.20","hasAvy":true,"id":"14638971"},{"firstName":"Fred","lastName":"Kerley","nat":"USA","pb":"9.76","sb":"10.03","hasAvy":true,"id":"14504382"},{"firstName":"Christian","lastName":"Coleman","nat":"USA","pb":"9.76","sb":"10.13","hasAvy":true,"id":"14541956"},{"firstName":"Akani","lastName":"Simbine","nat":"RSA","pb":"9.84","sb":"10.01","hasAvy":true,"id":"14417763"},{"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Eseme","nat":"CMR","pb":"9.96","sb":"10.14","hasAvy":true,"id":"14852717"},{"firstName":"Rohan","lastName":"Watson","nat":"JAM","pb":"9.91","sb":"10.27","hasAvy":true,"id":"14779154"},{"firstName":"Chen","lastName":"Guanfeng","nat":"CHN","pb":"10.06","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"14839760"}]},"3000m Steeplechase Women":{"date":"2024-04-27T19:28","url":"https://shanghai.diamondleague.com/programme-results/programme-results-shanghai/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"Predicted Finish and Times:\n\n1.

Her youth and upward momentum suggest potential for further breakthroughs.\n\n4. **Peruth Chemutai**'s Olympic gold medal and her performance in Accra with a time of 9:16.07 indicate she is a strong competitor, though recent times suggest she may not quite reach the leading pack.\n\n5. **Gesa Felicitas Krause** has a strong background with World Championship medals and a national record to her name. Her indoor performance in Leipzig and her consistent times make her a solid choice for a top finish.\n\n6. **Emma Coburn** has demonstrated longevity and success at the highest levels, including a World Championship gold. However, her times have not been on par with the very top of this field lately, suggesting a slight dip in form.\n\n7. **Lomi Muleta** and **Olivia Gürth** have shown potential and competitive times, but lack the standout performances of those ranked above them. Gürth's European U23 championship win suggests potential for an upset.\n\n8. **Daisy Jepkemei** has a strong personal best but recent performances suggest she might not be in peak form to challenge for the top positions.\n\n9-18.

Yanni Wu (CHN) - 12.95 seconds\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Tobi Amusan**: Amusan is the current world record holder with a staggering time of 12.12 seconds and has consistently shown excellent form, including a time of 12.33 seconds (+1.8m/s) at Hayward Field, Eugene, OR (USA). Her ability to perform under pressure and her recent performances suggest she can lead the pack, even with slight fluctuations in her times.\n\n2. **Jasmine Camacho-Quinn**: The Olympic gold medalist and holder of the Olympic record with a time of 12.26 seconds is a formidable competitor. Her consistent sub-12.5 performances and her ability to peak at major championships place her a close second. Her strong showing in the 2023 season, including a time of 12.38 seconds (+1.8) at Hayward Field, indicates she's in top form.\n\n3. **Danielle Williams**: The 2015 World Champion and a consistent performer on the global stage, Williams has shown she can compete with the best, with personal bests close to the top contenders. Her experience and recent performances, including a win in Budapest with a time of 12.43 seconds (-0.2), suggest she will be a strong contender.\n\n4. **Alaysha Johnson**: Johnson has shown significant improvement, and her personal best of 12.35 seconds places her among the elite. Despite less international success than the top three, her national level performances suggest she's close to making a breakthrough.\n\n5. **Masai Russell**: As the U.S NCAA Record holder in the 100m hurdles and with a personal best of 12.36 seconds, Russell is a rising star. However, her lack of experience at the very top level might hinder her from outperforming the more seasoned athletes above her in this prediction.\n\n6. **Devynne Charlton**: The Bahamian champion has shown she can compete at a high level, with a personal best of 12.44 seconds (+0.1) in Budapest. While competitive, she falls slightly short against the field's depth in international experience and achievements.\n\n7. **Megan Tapper**: Tapper, with a personal best of 12.53 seconds set in Tokyo, has shown she can perform on the big stage. However, her inconsistency at times places her lower in this prediction.\n\n8. **Ditaji Kambundji**: The young Swiss athlete has shown promise, especially with her bronze medal at the 2022 European Championships. However, her best times, while impressive, suggest she's just a step behind the more experienced competitors in this field.\n\n9. **Yanni Wu**: Wu, as a multiple-time Chinese national champion, has demonstrated her prowess domestically. However, her times are not quite at the level of her international competitors, suggesting she would finish at the back of this elite field.\n\nThis prediction takes into account the athletes' personal best times, their recent performance trends, and their experience in international competitions.

His trajectory suggests he's in prime form to edge out the competition with a slightly improved time.\n\n2. **Wyclife Kinyamal:** Kinyamal's personal best of 1:43.12 and gold at the Commonwealth Games signify his top-level performance capabilities. His consistent appearances near the top of major contests make him a strong contender for the silver.\n\n3. **Slimane Moula:** Given Moula's personal best of 1:43.38 and his victories in strong fields, he's expected to perform well. His Diamond League wins point to his ability to compete at the highest level.\n\n4. **Alex Ngeno Kipngetich:** Kipngetich's recent 1:44.07 performance and his upward trajectory in the field suggest he's close to a breakthrough, making him a strong candidate for a top finish.\n\n5. **Tshepiso Masalela:** Masalela's impressive time of 1:43.88 earlier in the year and consistent performance in sub-1:46 indicate his potential to challenge the leaders, placing him in the middle of the pack.\n\n6. **Clayton Murphy:** As a seasoned competitor with Olympic bronze and consistent sub-1:46 times, Murphy's experience on big stages could see him challenging the younger athletes, though perhaps not quite matching the top times.\n\n7. **Elias Ngeny:** Ngeny's personal best and recent performances suggest he's in good form, but the competitive field here might see him just outside the top spots.\n\n8. **Andreas Kramer:** Kramer's ability to perform well in European competitions and a solid personal best make him competitive in this field, though slightly off the pace of the leaders.\n\n9. **Mark English:** English has shown he can perform well, particularly on the European circuit, but his times suggest he'll find it tough to break into the top group in this field.\n\n10. **Abdelati el Guesse:** El Guesse has experience and has shown he can compete at a high level, but his recent performances suggest he might not be at his peak for this race.\n\n11. **Ethan Hussey:** The young British athlete shows promise with a personal best that puts him in contention. However, the depth of experience in this field might see him finishing in the lower half.\n\n12. **Dezhu Liu:** Liu's recent national record shows his potential, but competing against a field with more international experience might see him challenged to keep pace with the fastest times.\n\n13. **Patryk Sieradzki:** Sieradzki's inconsistency and tendency for DNFs suggest he might struggle in this high-caliber field, placing him at the back.\n\nThis prediction takes into account the athletes' recent performance trends, their personal bests, and their experience in international competitions. The top finishers are expected to be those who have consistently shown the ability to perform at or near their best in high-pressure situations, with a slight edge given to those with recent standout performances.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Mark","lastName":"English","nat":"IRL","pb":"1:44.71","sb":"1:46.61","hasAvy":true,"id":"14377494"},{"firstName":"Clayton","lastName":"Murphy","nat":"USA","pb":"1:42.93","sb":"1:45.38","hasAvy":true,"id":"14536714"},{"firstName":"Ermias","lastName":"Girma","nat":"ETH","pb":"1:44.36","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"14977658"},{"firstName":"Ethan","lastName":"Hussey","nat":"GBR","pb":"1:44.96","sb":"1:46.20","hasAvy":true,"id":"14815377"},{"firstName":"Slimane","lastName":"Moula","nat":"ALG","pb":"1:43.38","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"14747495"},{"firstName":"GUESSE Abdelati","lastName":"El","nat":"MAR","pb":"1:44.52","sb":"1:45.28","hasAvy":true,"id":"14652586"},{"firstName":"Tshepiso","lastName":"Masalela","nat":"BOT","pb":"1:43.88","sb":"1:43.88","hasAvy":true,"id":"14754326"},{"firstName":"Wyclife","lastName":"Kinyamal","nat":"KEN","pb":"1:43.12","sb":"1:43.66","hasAvy":true,"id":"14746603"},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Kramer","nat":"SWE","pb":"1:44.47","sb":"1:44.81","hasAvy":true,"id":"14538207"},{"firstName":"Alex Ngeno","lastName":"Kipngetich","nat":"KEN","pb":"1:44.07","sb":"1:44.07","hasAvy":true,"id":"14798146"},{"firstName":"Elias","lastName":"Ngeny","nat":"KEN","pb":"1:43.84","sb":"1:44.79","hasAvy":true,"id":"14849580"},{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Sieradzki","nat":"POL","pb":"1:45.13","sb":"1:47.20","hasAvy":true,"id":"14647295"}]},"200m Women":{"tiebreaker":"21.90","date":"2024-04-27T20:14","url":"https://shanghai.diamondleague.com/programme-results/programme-results-shanghai/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"### Predicted Finish and Times for Women's 200 Metres\n\n1. **Sha'Carri Richardson (USA)** - 21.85\n2. **Daryll Neita (GBR)** - 22.05\n3. **Twanisha Terry (USA)** - 22.10\n4. **Tamara Clark (USA)** - 22.20\n5. **Anavia Battle (USA)** - 22.40\n6. **Anthonique Strachan (BAH)** - 22.45\n7. **Caisja Chandler (USA)** - 22.60\n8. **Mujinga Kambundji (SUI)** - 22.75\n\n### Reasoning Behind the Predictions\n\n- **Sha'Carri Richardson** is placed first with a predicted time of 21.85, reflecting her consistently impressive performance history, including a remarkable 21.61 at Hayward Field, Eugene, OR (USA), albeit with a +2.6 wind assistance. Even in less favorable conditions, she has managed to put up times in the range of 21.92 to 22.18, showcasing her ability to perform under various circumstances. Her personal best and the fact that she has been the sixth-fastest woman of all time in the 100m indicate her exceptional speed over the shorter sprint, which translates well into the 200m.\n\n- **Daryll Neita (GBR)** is predicted second with a time of 22.05, taking into account her consistent performance across both 100m and 200m distances. Neita's ability to maintain strong finishes in major competitions and her recent good form, including times close to her personal bests, suggest she's in a strong position to challenge in this field.\n\n- **Twanisha Terry (USA)**, with a predicted time of 22.10, has shown remarkable potential and speed, especially noted in her 100m performances. Her 22.38 performance at Hayward Field indicates her capability in the 200m. Given her upward trajectory and potential, she's expected to be a strong contender.\n\n- **Tamara Clark (USA)** lands in fourth with a time of 22.20. Clark's recent performances, including a 22.05 and 22.02 at Hayward Field, suggest she's in good form. However, compared to Richardson and the others ahead of her, there's a slight gap in her top-end speed this season, placing her just outside the top three.\n\n- **Anavia Battle (USA)** is predicted fifth with a time of 22.40. Battle has shown consistent performances but hasn't quite reached the peak performances of those ranked above her. Her best times in the 22.4x range suggest she's competitive but has a bit more to find to challenge for the top spots.\n\n- **Anthonique Strachan (BAH)**, with a predicted sixth-place finish at 22.45, has had strong performances, including a 22.15 in Rabat. However, her inconsistency and recent performances suggest she might not have the form to challenge the top of this highly competitive field.\n\n- **Caisja Chandler (USA)** is placed seventh with a predicted time of 22.60. While Chandler has shown promise, especially with a 22.37 performance at Mike A. Myers Stadium, her times have been a bit off the pace compared to the leading contenders in this prediction.\n\n- **Mujinga Kambundji (SUI)** rounds out the field with a time of 22.75. Despite her impressive resume, including a bronze medal in the 200 metres at the 2019 World Championships, her recent performances suggest she might find it challenging to keep up with the younger and quicker field in this race.\n\nThese predictions are based on recent performances, taking into account the athletes' consistency, their peak performances, and their trajectory leading up to this hypothetical race. Significantly, Richardson's explosive speed and Neita's proven competition record underpin their top placements.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Caisja","lastName":"Chandler","nat":"USA","pb":"22.37","sb":"23.72","hasAvy":true,"id":"14731976"},{"firstName":"Mujinga","lastName":"Kambundji","nat":"SUI","pb":"22.05","sb":"23.39","hasAvy":true,"id":"14300897"},{"firstName":"Anthonique","lastName":"Strachan","nat":"BAH","pb":"22.15","sb":"24.21","hasAvy":true,"id":"14368117"},{"firstName":"Anavia","lastName":"Battle","nat":"USA","pb":"21.95","sb":"22.56","hasAvy":true,"id":"14715397"},{"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Clark","nat":"USA","pb":"21.92","sb":"22.21","hasAvy":true,"id":"14596381"},{"firstName":"Sha'Carri","lastName":"Richardson","nat":"USA","pb":"21.92","sb":"22.99","hasAvy":true,"id":"14717691"},{"firstName":"Daryll","lastName":"Neita","nat":"GBR","pb":"22.16","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"14476603"},{"firstName":"Twanisha","lastName":"Terry","nat":"USA","pb":"22.17","sb":"23.25","hasAvy":true,"id":"14553598"}]},"5000m Men":{"date":"2024-04-27T20:27","url":"https://shanghai.diamondleague.com/programme-results/programme-results-shanghai/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Predicted Finish and Times for the Men's 5000 Metres:**\n\n1.

Mounir Akbache (FRA) - DNF\n\n**Rationale:**\n\n1. **Lamecha Girma** stands out as the favorite due to his impressive track record, including the world indoor record for the 3000m set in February 2023, and a strong performance in the 5000m in April 2024. His consistent top finishes in the steeplechase and other distances suggest outstanding form and versatility.\n\n2. **Selemon Barega** has the pedigree and the performances, including a close second in the 5000m at Zürich in August 2023, to be Girma's closest challenger. His Olympic and World Championships medals showcase his high-level competition experience and ability to perform on the big stage.\n\n3. **Ronald Kwemoi** has shown strong form across various distances, including a solid performance in the 5000m in April 2024. His ability to compete at both the 1500m and 5000m distances suggests he has the speed and endurance necessary for a top finish.\n\n4. **Samwel Chebolei Masai**'s performance in April 2024 places him among the favorites. His recent performances indicate a potential for breaking into the top rankings.\n\n5. **Biniam Mehary** is a rising star with a recent under-20 world record in the 1500m indoors. Despite being the youngest, his exceptional performances suggest he could surprise many with a strong finish among more experienced competitors.\n\n6. **Benson Kiplangat** has shown promise with consistent performances in the 5000m and should not be underestimated. His ability to perform well in both cross country and on the track suggests good versatility.\n\n7. **Oscar Chelimo** has a solid bronze from the 2022 World Athletics Championships, indicating he can compete at the highest level, though his recent performances suggest a slight dip in form.\n\n8. **Kuma Girma** has shown he can compete with the best, but his performances have been slightly inconsistent. However, his strong showing in April 2024 suggests he's in good form.\n\n9. **Brian Fay** and **Mohamed Abdilaahi** have shown they are capable of competing at a high level, with Fay posting some strong times in Europe and Abdilaahi demonstrating his ability across a range of distances.\n\n10. **Mike Foppen**, **Morgan McDonald**, and **Nibret Melak** have shown they can perform well but may not have the same level of standout performances as those ranked above them in this prediction.\n\n11. **Kieran Tuntivate**, **Jack Rayner**, **Matthew Ramsden**, **Dan Kibet**, **Bastien Augusto**, **Callum Davies**, and **Sam Parsons** have shown promise but based on recent performances, they are not expected to challenge for the top spots in this highly competitive field.\n\n12. **Mounir Akbache**'s recent pattern of DNFs suggests he may struggle to complete the race, reflecting potential issues with form or fitness.\n\nThe predicted times take into account the athletes' recent performances, their progression, and the competitive nature of the field, which is likely to push all competitors to achieve their best.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Biniam","lastName":"Mehary","nat":"ETH","pb":"","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"15118094"},{"firstName":"Nibret","lastName":"Kinde","nat":"ETH","pb":"","sb":"","hasAvy":false,"id":"15058748"},{"firstName":"Morgan","lastName":"Mcdonald","nat":"AUS","pb":"13:07.30","sb":"13:07.30","hasAvy":true,"id":"14496066"},{"firstName":"Dan","lastName":"Kibet","nat":"UGA","pb":"13:16.31","sb":"13:24.64","hasAvy":true,"id":"14913746"},{"firstName":"Nibret","lastName":"Melak","nat":"ETH","pb":"12:54.22","sb":"13:23.06","hasAvy":true,"id":"14840778"},{"firstName":"Sam","lastName":"Parsons","nat":"GER","pb":"13:12.78","sb":"13:19.70","hasAvy":true,"id":"14628221"},{"firstName":"Kieran","lastName":"Tuntivate","nat":"THA","pb":"13:08.41","sb":"13:49.20","hasAvy":true,"id":"14647807"},{"firstName":"Bastien","lastName":"Augusto","nat":"FRA","pb":"13:16.85","sb":"13:16.85","hasAvy":true,"id":"14869306"},{"firstName":"Jack","lastName":"Rayner","nat":"AUS","pb":"13:06.00","sb":"13:16.34","hasAvy":true,"id":"14517160"},{"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Abdilaahi","nat":"GER","pb":"13:03.18","sb":"13:16.43","hasAvy":true,"id":"14753471"},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Ramsden","nat":"AUS","pb":"13:16.63","sb":"13:17.22","hasAvy":true,"id":"14576384"},{"firstName":"Mike","lastName":"Foppen","nat":"NED","pb":"13:05.66","sb":"13:08.60","hasAvy":true,"id":"14631296"},{"firstName":"Brian","lastName":"Fay","nat":"IRL","pb":"13:01.40","sb":"13:14.97","hasAvy":true,"id":"14781522"},{"firstName":"Kuma","lastName":"Girma","nat":"ETH","pb":"13:03.37","sb":"13:04.45","hasAvy":true,"id":"14975226"},{"firstName":"Benson","lastName":"Kiplangat","nat":"KEN","pb":"13:02.74","sb":"13:04.66","hasAvy":true,"id":"14989931"},{"firstName":"Ronald","lastName":"Kwemoi","nat":"KEN","pb":"13:02.56","sb":"13:02.56","hasAvy":true,"id":"14577960"},{"firstName":"Samwel Chebolei","lastName":"Masai","nat":"KEN","pb":"13:00.69","sb":"13:00.69","hasAvy":true,"id":"14798170"},{"firstName":"Selemon","lastName":"Barega","nat":"ETH","pb":"12:43.02","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"14751317"},{"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Akbache","nat":"FRA","pb":"","sb":"","hasAvy":true,"id":"14182819"},{"firstName":"Callum","lastName":"Davies","nat":"AUS","pb":"13:47.20","sb":"13:47.20","hasAvy":true,"id":"14690926"}]},"110m Hurdles Men":{"date":"2024-04-27T20:53","url":"https://shanghai.diamondleague.com/programme-results/programme-results-shanghai/","deadline":"7am ET","blurb":"**Race Prediction and Preview for the Men's 110 Metres Hurdles:**\n\n1. Daniel Roberts (USA), 12.98 seconds\n2. Hansle Parchment (JAM), 13.02 seconds\n3. Cordell Tinch (USA), 13.05 seconds\n4. Freddie Crittenden (USA), 13.10 seconds\n5. Shunsuke Izumiya (JPN), 13.12 seconds\n6. Wilhem Belocian (FRA), 13.17 seconds\n7. Jamal Britt (USA), 13.20 seconds\n8. Eric Edwards (USA), 13.24 seconds\n9. Zhuoyi Xu (CHN), 13.45 seconds\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Daniel Roberts**: Placing Roberts at the top of the list with a predicted time of 12.98 seconds is based on his consistent performances close to or under the 13-second mark, including a notable 13.01 seconds at Icahn Stadium, New York. His bronze medal at the 2023 World Championships indicates he's in prime condition and can perform under pressure, showcasing his potential to lead this field.\n\n2. **Hansle Parchment**: The reigning Olympic champion's experience on the big stage cannot be underestimated. With a season's best of 12.93 seconds at Eugene and his consistent sub-13.20 performances, Parchment's ability to peak at the right moments places him as a strong contender for a top finish, predicted at 13.02 seconds.\n\n3. **Cordell Tinch**: As a relatively new name making significant strides, Tinch has shown impressive versatility across events. However, his ability to clock 13.04 seconds at Hayward Field, coupled with a 12.96 seconds performance, suggests a high ceiling in the hurdles. A predicted time of 13.05 seconds reflects his potential to challenge the more experienced competitors.\n\n4. **Freddie Crittenden**: A silver medalist at the Pan American Games, Crittenden has shown he can compete with the best. His times have been consistently around the low 13-second mark, with a season's best of 13.13 seconds. His experience and ability to perform under pressure earn him a predicted fourth-place finish at 13.10 seconds.\n\n5. **Shunsuke Izumiya**: The young Japanese hurdler has been closing in on the 13-second barrier, with a personal best of 13.04 seconds. This performance, coupled with his bronze medal at the 2019 Summer Universiade, indicates his rising form and potential to disrupt the standings, predicted at 13.12 seconds.\n\n6. **Wilhem Belocian**: The French hurdler has shown consistency in his performances, with times hovering around the low to mid-13 seconds. His best performance of the season, 13.07 seconds, suggests he is capable of a strong finish, hence the prediction of 13.17 seconds.\n\n7. **Jamal Britt**: Known for his versatility, Britt has shown promise in the hurdles with a personal best of 12.99 seconds, albeit with a significant wind assistance. His capacity to deliver strong performances, such as a 13.19 seconds finish at Icahn Stadium, places him with a predicted time of 13.20 seconds.\n\n8. **Eric Edwards**: With a collegiate history of impressive performances and a personal best of 13.15 seconds, Edwards' potential is clear. His ability to perform close to his best under varying conditions earns him a predicted finish time of 13.24 seconds.\n\n9. **Zhuoyi Xu**: As the youngest competitor in this prediction, Xu has shown potential with times consistently improving towards the low 13-second range. His recent performances suggest a trajectory towards faster times, but the experience and depth of the field place him at a predicted 13.45 seconds.\n\nThis race prediction takes into account not only the athletes' personal bests but also their recent form, their performances under varying conditions, and their proven ability to compete at high-stakes competitions. While the predictions are speculative, they are grounded in the athletes' demonstrated capabilities and trajectories.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Jamal","lastName":"Britt","nat":"USA","pb":"13.08","sb":"13.48","hasAvy":true,"id":"14769264"},{"firstName":"XU","lastName":"Zhuoyi","nat":"CHN","pb":"13.39","sb":"13.72","hasAvy":true,"id":"14885102"},{"firstName":"Shunsuke","lastName":"Izumiya","nat":"JPN","pb":"13.04","sb":"13.17","hasAvy":true,"id":"14815041"},{"firstName":"Daniel","lastName":"Roberts","nat":"USA","pb":"13.00","sb":"13.11","hasAvy":true,"id":"14577558"},{"firstName":"Hansle","lastName":"Parchment","nat":"JAM","pb":"12.93","sb":"13.33","hasAvy":true,"id":"14325570"},{"firstName":"Cordell","lastName":"Tinch","nat":"USA","pb":"12.96","sb":"13.16","hasAvy":true,"id":"14719972"},{"firstName":"Freddie","lastName":"Crittenden","nat":"USA","pb":"13.00","sb":"13.30","hasAvy":true,"id":"14491556"},{"firstName":"Eric","lastName":"Edwards","nat":"USA","pb":"13.15","sb":"13.31","hasAvy":true,"id":"14716336"},{"firstName":"ZHU","lastName":"Shenglong","nat":"CHN","pb":"13.25","sb":"13.54","hasAvy":true,"id":"14805837"}]}}}
