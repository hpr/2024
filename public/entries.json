{"rabat23":{"400m Hurdles Women":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:04","blurb":"Predicted Finishing Order and Times:\n\n1. Dalilah Muhammad (USA): 51.90 \n2. Shamier Little (USA): 52.35 \n3. Rushell Clayton (JAM): 52.80 \n4. Janieve Russell (JAM): 53.10 \n5. Anna Ryzhykova (UKR): 53.45 \n6. Gianna Woodruff (PAN): 53.75 \n7. Shiann Salmon (JAM): 54.20 \n8. Noura Ennadi (MAR): 56.70 \n\nReasoning: \n\n1. **Dalilah Muhammad** is expected to emerge victorious in this race, given her strong record and exceptional Personal Best (PB). Despite a lack of results in 400m Hurdles this year, she's shown competitive form in various indoor events. Her 200m and 300m results hint at good speed, while her 4x400m relay performances show good endurance. Muhammad's high experience level and world-record pedigree should not be underestimated.\n\n2. **Shamier Little** has been consistently performing well throughout the season, with a string of 1st and 2nd place finishes. Her strong 400m and 600m indoor results indicate she has the speed and endurance required for the 400m hurdles, though her DNF in the 800m raises some questions about her fitness.\n\n3. **Rushell Clayton** has also been showing good form, already running close to her personal best this year in the 400m Hurdles. She's been consistently in the top places in her races and should provide stiff competition to the top two.\n\n4. **Janieve Russell** may struggle to overcome the top three, despite having a strong PB. Her inconsistent performances this season, finishing 3rd, 5th, and 2nd in her 400m races, show a certain lack of form.\n\n5. **Anna Ryzhykova**'s results indicate a good level of fitness and speed, but her lack of recent hurdles-specific training could hinder her performance.\n\n6. **Gianna Woodruff** has not hit her stride this season, running several seconds off her personal best in the 400m Hurdles. Unless she finds significant improvement, it's unlikely she'll finish higher.\n\n7. **Shiann Salmon**, while young and promising, has had mixed results in her 400m and 400m hurdles races. Her times are somewhat off the pace set by the top runners in this race, which suggests she might struggle against this field.\n\n8. **Noura Ennadi** is relatively inexperienced and her PB is significantly slower than the other competitors. Running on home soil may provide a boost, but she's still likely to finish at the back of the pack.\n\nUltimately, this is going to be a race between Muhammad and Little. Both have demonstrated the speed and endurance necessary for a 400m hurdles race, but Muhammad's experience and previous record-breaking performances give her the edge. That said, as always in athletics, anything can happen on the day, and a single stumble or poor hurdle clearance could drastically alter the outcome.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Dalilah","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"14317560","pb":"51.58","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shamier","lastName":"Little","id":"14443767","pb":"52.39","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Ryzhykova","id":"14304336","pb":"52.96","sb":null,"nat":"UKR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Janieve","lastName":"Russell","id":"14334022","pb":"53.08","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Rushell","lastName":"Clayton","id":"14425208","pb":"53.33","sb":"54.41","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Gianna","lastName":"Woodruff","id":"14423522","pb":"53.69","sb":"56.62","nat":"PAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shiann","lastName":"Salmon","id":"14574022","pb":"53.82","sb":"55.83","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Noura","lastName":"Ennadi","id":"14793929","pb":"56.45","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":false}]},"800m Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:15","blurb":"The 800m race at the Rabat Diamond League track meet promises to be a thrilling event with a host of accomplished runners. However, predicting the exact order and times can be quite tricky given the uncertainty and variability in athletic performances. Nevertheless, here's my projected final placements based on the data available:\n\n1. Emmanuel Kipkurui Korir (KEN) - 1:43.18\n2. Wyclife Kinyamal (KEN) - 1:43.45\n3. Emmanuel Wanyonyi (KEN) - 1:43.50\n4. Marco Arop (CAN) - 1:43.60\n5. Moad Zahafi (MAR) - 1:45.25\n6. Benjamin Robert (FRA) - 1:45.40\n7. Tony van Diepen (NED) - 1:45.80\n8. Slimane Moula (ALG) - 1:46.15\n9. Abdelati el Guesse (MAR) - 1:46.50\n10. Patryk Sieradzki (POL) - 1:46.75\n\nKorir's performance towards the end of 2022 showed consistency and great potential, as evidenced by his impressive performances at Hayward Field, Stadion Śląski, and Letzigrund. However, his lack of participation this season in the 800m might indicate a slightly slower time.\n\nWyclife Kinyamal is a serious contender for the top spot, with his recent performance of 1:43.66. His times have been consistent, but Korir's experience and past achievements give him a slight edge.\n\nWanyonyi, the youngest contender, is a wild card with great potential. His recent time of 1:43.32 is quite impressive, however, his relative lack of experience in high-level international meets like the Diamond League might work against him.\n\nMarco Arop, despite having no recent performance in the 800m, had a promising 2022 season, and his personal best is quite competitive. However, his DNF earlier in the year is a cause for concern.\n\nZahafi's personal best is promising, but his recent performance isn't as impressive. Similarly, Benjamin Robert is a strong indoor athlete, but it remains to be seen how he translates this form to outdoor events.\n\nTony van Diepen and Slimane Moula have shown potential in 2023, but their personal bests fall short of the Kenyan athletes. Abdelati el Guesse, despite his age, shows potential, but a recent DNF could indicate issues.\n\nPatryk Sieradzki, although a strong contender, has had a few DNFs this year, which could indicate potential issues with consistency or injury, thus placing him at the bottom of the rankings.\n\nOf course, these are only predictions. The beauty of track and field is its unpredictability, and any athlete could potentially have a breakthrough performance.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Emmanuel Kipkurui","lastName":"Korir","id":"14755084","pb":"1:42.05","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wyclife","lastName":"Kinyamal","id":"14746603","pb":"1:43.12","sb":"1:43.66","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Arop","id":"14755875","pb":"1:43.26","sb":null,"nat":"CAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Wanyonyi","id":"14974928","pb":"1:43.32","sb":"1:43.32","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Moad","lastName":"Zahafi","id":"14707135","pb":"1:43.69","sb":"1:48.17","nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Robert","id":"14683828","pb":"1:43.75","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"van Diepen","id":"14534783","pb":"1:44.14","sb":null,"nat":"NED","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Slimane","lastName":"Moula","id":"14747495","pb":"1:44.19","sb":"1:46.06","nat":"ALG","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Abdelati","lastName":"el Guesse","id":"14652586","pb":"1:44.84","sb":"1:47.00","nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Sieradzki","id":"14647295","pb":"1:45.13","sb":null,"nat":"POL","hasAvy":false}]},"400m Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:52","blurb":"Predicted Final Places and Times:\n\n1. Steven Gardiner (BAH) - 43.62\n2. Vernon Norwood (USA) - 44.58\n3. Bayapo Ndori (BOT) - 44.64\n4. Rusheen McDonald (JAM) - 44.78\n5. Matthew Hudson-Smith (GBR) - 45.12\n6. Zakhiti Nene (RSA) - 45.37\n7. Ricky Petrucciani (SUI) - 45.82\n8. Hamza Dair (MAR) - 46.24\n\nExplanation:\n\nSteven Gardiner, with the best personal best (43.48), takes my pick for first place. His shorter distance results this season suggest he is in good form, and even though he has not run a 400m race yet this season, his excellent performances in 300m and 200m races show he's maintaining speed and strength.\n\nVernon Norwood's season has been quite impressive. His season's best (44.68) is the best among all competitors and his consistent performances at both 200m and 400m suggest he is in good form. Given his experience at the age of 31, I expect him to deliver a strong performance and secure second place.\n\nBayapo Ndori is an interesting contender. His personal best is not far off from Vernon Norwood, and his season's best equals Norwood's. Despite a dip in his most recent 400m race, he has the youth and the potential to bounce back for a strong finish.\n\nRusheen McDonald, while experienced, has been inconsistent this season with times ranging from mid 45s to high 46s in the 400m. His season's best is decent but considering his recent performances, it seems more likely he will fall short of his personal best.\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith, even though he has a good personal best, his recent times are slower and he has not been consistent this season. His failed attempts at the 400m and the relay race in April suggest he might be struggling with form or fitness.\n\nZakhiti Nene has a good personal best but his season's best is quite far off from it. His recent times have been inconsistent, oscillating in the mid to high 45s. He would need a major improvement to compete with the top finishers.\n\nRicky Petrucciani's personal best is decent, but without any 400m outdoor races in 2023, it's tough to gauge his form. His indoor performances, while solid, are not enough to predict a strong finish in this competitive field.\n\nFinally, Hamza Dair, the youngest competitor, doesn't have a great personal or season's best. His disqualification in the indoor 400m in January and lack of 400m races this season does not inspire confidence in a strong performance.\n\nIn summary, this race is likely to be dominated by the more experienced athletes with proven track records, with Gardiner and Norwood leading the way. The younger athletes such as Ndori and Dair have potential, but they'll need to surpass their personal bests to stand a chance against these seasoned competitors.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Gardiner","id":"14578505","pb":"43.48","sb":null,"nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Rusheen","lastName":"McDonald","id":"14468667","pb":"43.93","sb":"45.26","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Hudson-Smith","id":"14407278","pb":"44.35","sb":"45.28","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Vernon","lastName":"Norwood","id":"14490237","pb":"44.35","sb":"44.68","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Bayapo","lastName":"Ndori","id":"14847443","pb":"44.61","sb":"44.61","nat":"BOT","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Zakhiti","lastName":"Nene","id":"14696997","pb":"44.74","sb":"45.47","nat":"RSA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ricky","lastName":"Petrucciani","id":"14742772","pb":"45.02","sb":null,"nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":"Dair","id":"14843148","pb":"45.65","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":false}]},"100m Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T20:25","blurb":"Predicted Final Placements and Times:\n\n1.

Chakir MacHmour (MAR): 10.18 seconds\n\nReasoning:\n\nFerdinand Omanyala has been on a roll this season with consistently strong performances and times near his personal best. He's the only one to have run sub-9.80 this season, even if it was wind-assisted. This, along with his high-frequency racing schedule, shows he's in top form.\n\nTrayvon Bromell had a strong indoor season and has been showing consistent performance in the 60 meters. He may not have as many 100m races this year, but his history and his strong indoor performance suggest that he's in top form.\n\nLamont Marcell Jacobs has been consistently strong in the 60 meters this season and has run sub-9.90 before. His indoor performance suggests he's ready for a quick 100 meters.\n\nFred Kerley and Akani Simbine are the next two. Kerley has been focusing on the 200m and 400m, but his 9.76 personal best shows he's a serious contender. Simbine's season best is close to his personal best, and he's shown consistent performance.\n\nLetsile Tebogo and Yohan Blake are hard to place. Tebogo is young and his performance seems to be improving quickly, but his lack of 100m races this year makes him a wild card. Blake's times this season aren't close to his personal best, but he has the experience and the talent to pull out a good time if he's in top form.\n\nAndre de Grasse's recent times suggest he's not in top form, and he hasn't run sub-10 this season. Chakir MacHmour has the slowest personal best and his recent times aren't competitive with the rest of the field.\n\nPlease note that this is a highly speculative analysis. There are many variables in a race, and even small changes can have a big impact on the final result.

After finishing fourth in Doha earlier this month, he will be aiming to improve his performance and is the man to beat in this race.\n\nKipruto, with a personal best just shy of the 8-minute mark at 8:00.12, was a dominant force in 2022, consistently finishing within the top five. However, his times have been inconsistent, suggesting he may be past his peak. \n\nKigen and Kibiwot, both from Kenya, and Ethiopia's Wale are likely to be pushing for the top spots. Kigen has had a mixed season but his personal best time of 8:05.12 shows his potential. Wale, the youngest in the field at 22, may be the dark horse of the competition with his 8:05.21 personal best.\n\nMeanwhile, Bedrani (FRA) and Bor (USA) will lead the charge for the non-African contingent. Bedrani, in particular, has shown promise with a personal best of 8:05.23.\n\nOverall, the Rabat Diamond League 3000m Steeplechase is set to be a highly competitive race filled with thrilling moments and possibly unexpected results. All eyes will certainly be on the home favourite, El Bakkali, to see if he can seize the top spot.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Soufiane","lastName":"el Bakkali","id":"14590424","pb":"7:58.15","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Conseslus","lastName":"Kipruto","id":"14479159","pb":"8:00.12","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Kigen","id":"14590800","pb":"8:05.12","sb":"8:30.81","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Getnet","lastName":"Wale","id":"14760253","pb":"8:05.21","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Djilali","lastName":"Bedrani","id":"14423830","pb":"8:05.23","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Kibiwot","id":"14657344","pb":"8:05.72","sb":"8:19.71","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hailemariyam","lastName":"Amare","id":"14657460","pb":"8:06.29","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hillary","lastName":"Bor","id":"14232976","pb":"8:08.41","sb":"8:20.67","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Leonard Kipkemoi","lastName":"Bett","id":"14802643","pb":"8:08.61","sb":"8:20.02","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Amos","lastName":"Serem","id":"14808796","pb":"8:09.93","sb":"8:25.61","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Zoghlami","id":"14530462","pb":"8:11.00","sb":null,"nat":"ITA","hasAvy":false},{"firstName":"Avinash Mukund","lastName":"Sable","id":"14778911","pb":"8:11.20","sb":null,"nat":"IND","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Tindouft","id":"14773269","pb":"8:11.65","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Belhadj","id":"14549862","pb":"8:12.43","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mohamed Amin","lastName":"Jhinaoui","id":"14735778","pb":"8:16.38","sb":null,"nat":"TUN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Salaheddine","lastName":"ben Yazide","id":"14977838","pb":"8:19.63","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wilberforce Chemiat","lastName":"Kones","id":"14755096","pb":"8:21.42","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":false},{"firstName":"Abderrafia","lastName":"Bouassel","id":"14843153","pb":"8:27.00","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":false}]}}}
