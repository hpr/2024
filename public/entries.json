{"brussels23":{"400m Women":{"date":"2023-09-08T20:04","blurb":"Predicted Finish:\n\n1. Sada Williams (BAR) - 49.50\n2. Lieke Klaver (NED) - 49.80\n3. Shamier Little (USA) - 50.01\n4. Candice McLeod (JAM) - 50.15\n5. Mary Moraa (KEN) - 50.18\n6. Cynthia Bolingo (BEL) - 50.25\n7. Laviai Nielsen (GBR) - 50.40\n8. Helena Ponette (BEL) - 51.00\n\nSada Williams from Barbados is my pick for the top spot, given her consistent performances throughout the season. Her recent wins in Budapest and her strong performance in Xiamen, where she clocked 50.95, indicate she is in good form. Williams' bronze medal at the 2022 World Championships and a gold at the 2022 Commonwealth Games also demonstrate her ability to perform on the big stage.\n\nLieke Klaver from the Netherlands is predicted to finish a close second. Her times have consistently been under 51 seconds and she came first in the 400m at the 2023 World Championships. Klaver's recent wins in Budapest, where she ran under 50 seconds, indicate she has the potential to challenge Williams for the top spot.\n\nAmerican Shamier Little, a specialist in the 400 metres hurdles, is expected to finish third. Her recent performances, such as a second-place finish in Budapest with a time of 52.80, show she can compete with the best in the 400 metres as well.\n\nCandice McLeod from Jamaica is expected to finish fourth. Her times have been consistent, but she has struggled to break into the top three in recent races. However, her first place finish in Kingston in July shows she has the potential to challenge for a higher position.\n\nKenya's Mary Moraa, despite being primarily an 800m runner, is predicted to finish fifth. Her recent first-place finishes in the 800m in Budapest demonstrate her strong form, but the 400m might be a bit short for her to fully utilize her endurance.\n\nCynthia Bolingo from Belgium is predicted to finish sixth. Despite her recent second-place finish in Budapest, her times have been slightly slower than the top athletes in this race.\n\nBritain's Laviai Nielsen is predicted to finish seventh. Her recent times have been consistent, but she has struggled to break into the top three in high-level competitions.\n\nHelena Ponette, also from Belgium, is predicted to finish eighth. Despite some solid performances, her times have generally been slower compared to the other athletes in this race.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Candice","lastName":"McLeod","id":"14587165","pb":"49.51","sb":"50.19","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Sada","lastName":"Williams","id":"14592846","pb":"49.58","sb":"49.58","nat":"BAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shamier","lastName":"Little","id":"14443767","pb":"49.68","sb":"49.68","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lieke","lastName":"Klaver","id":"14560483","pb":"49.81","sb":"49.81","nat":"NED","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Cynthia","lastName":"Bolingo","id":"14360768","pb":"49.96","sb":"49.96","nat":"BEL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Moraa","id":"14798209","pb":"50.38","sb":"50.38","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Laviai","lastName":"Nielsen","id":"14599229","pb":"50.83","sb":"50.83","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Helena","lastName":"Ponette","id":"14659039","pb":"51.52","sb":"51.52","nat":"BEL","hasAvy":true}]},"1500m Women":{"date":"2023-09-08T20:13","entrants":[{"firstName":"Laura","lastName":"Muir","id":"14422111","pb":"3:54.50","sb":"3:56.36","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hirut","lastName":"Meshesha","id":"14805826","pb":"3:54.87","sb":"3:54.87","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Birke","lastName":"Haylom","id":"15009582","pb":"3:54.93","sb":"3:54.93","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ciara","lastName":"Mageean","id":"14275665","pb":"3:56.61","sb":"3:56.61","nat":"IRL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Nelly","lastName":"Chepchirchir","id":"14892139","pb":"3:56.72","sb":"3:56.72","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Katie","lastName":"Snowden","id":"14360725","pb":"3:56.72","sb":"3:56.72","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Linden","lastName":"Hall","id":"14272002","pb":"3:57.27","sb":"3:57.27","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Hull","id":"14464506","pb":"3:57.29","sb":"3:57.29","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Melissa","lastName":"Courtney-Bryant","id":"14274781","pb":"3:58.01","sb":"3:58.01","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Marta","lastName":"Pérez","id":"14452646","pb":"4:00.12","sb":"4:01.41","nat":"ESP","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Esther","lastName":"Guerrero","id":"14261358","pb":"4:00.13","sb":"4:00.13","nat":"ESP","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Claudia Mihaela","lastName":"Bobocea","id":"14377909","pb":"4:01.10","sb":"4:03.80","nat":"ROU","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Elise","lastName":"Vanderelst","id":"14526691","pb":"4:02.63","sb":"4:05.26","nat":"BEL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Addison","lastName":"Wiley","id":"14907337","pb":"4:03.22","sb":"4:03.22","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Purity","lastName":"Chepkirui","id":"14989663","pb":"4:04.51","sb":"4:04.51","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Noélie","lastName":"Yarigo","id":"14270067","pb":"4:20.09","sb":null,"nat":"BEN","hasAvy":true}]},"200m Men":{"date":"2023-09-08T20:28","blurb":"1.

Even though Bednarek has a better personal best, his recent performance has been slightly less consistent, thus placing him second. Hughes should not be underestimated, having shown a strong performance this season and breaking both British sprint records. \n\nFourth place goes to Fahnbulleh, who, despite being a newcomer to the field, has shown promise with a 4th place at the 2022 World Athletics Championships. Tortu, despite his notable relay successes, hasn't been as strong in the 200 meters, which places him in the middle of the pack.\n\nBrown, despite his Olympic medals in the relay, hasn't been as strong individually in the 200 meters, leading to a 6th place prediction. De Grasse, despite his Olympic success, has struggled in recent races and seems to be on a downward trend, placing him 7th. Lastly, King, despite his relay success, hasn't been able to break the 20-second barrier in the 200 meters, which places him at the bottom of this prediction.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"de

Maureen Koster (NED) - 15:10.67\n11. Caroline Nyaga (KEN) - 15:13.81\n12. Camilla Richardsson (FIN) - 15:15.45\n\nPreview:\n\nNozomi Tanaka is predicted to clinch the gold with a time of 14:46.01. She's had a string of impressive performances this year, particularly noticeable is her transition from middle-distance to long-distance, with strong finishes in the 5000 metres. Her recent 5000m wins in Osaka and Oulu, coupled with her impressive 1500m performance, suggest she's in prime form for this event. \n\nMedina Eisa, a young Ethiopian prodigy, is expected to finish closely behind Tanaka. She's been consistently performing well in the 5000 metres, and her notable performances in Germany and France earlier this year are a testament to that. However, her inconsistent performances in Budapest might hinder her chances of taking the gold.\n\nLilian Kasait Rengeruk of Kenya is predicted to take third place. Despite a recent ban, Rengeruk has shown her resilience by bouncing back with strong performances, especially her 5000 metre wins in Nairobi. However, her recent 5th and 10th place finishes in Budapest suggest she might not have the edge to best Tanaka and Eisa.\n\nElise Cranny of the USA, who has shown consistent improvement in her 5000 metre times, is expected to finish fourth. Her recent 5th place finish in Budapest shows her potential, though her performance in Monaco suggests she might lack the final kick needed to secure a podium finish.\n\nEdinah Jebitok and Winnie Jemutai, both from Kenya, are predicted to take the fifth and sixth spots. Jebitok's recent 3rd place finish in Berlin shows promise, but her inconsistent performance may prevent her from securing a higher spot. Jemutai, despite a strong performance in Paris earlier this year, seems to struggle in maintaining her form, as shown in her recent race in Budapest.\n\nThe rest of the spots are expected to be closely contested, with athletes like Grace Loibach Nawowuna, Jessica Warner-Judd, and Karoline Bjerkeli Grøvdal showing potential but not enough consistency to challenge the top runners. Maureen Koster, Caroline Nyaga, and Camilla Richardsson, despite their experience, seem to struggle to keep up with the pace of the younger and more in-form competitors.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Medina","lastName":"Eisa","id":"14985841","pb":"14:16.54","sb":"14:16.54","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lilian Kasait","lastName":"Rengeruk","id":"14590678","pb":"14:23.05","sb":"14:23.05","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Karoline Bjerkeli","lastName":"Grøvdal","id":"14292573","pb":"14:31.07","sb":"14:45.24","nat":"NOR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Nozomi","lastName":"Tanaka","id":"14632538","pb":"14:37.98","sb":"14:37.98","nat":"JPN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Grace Loibach","lastName":"Nawowuna","id":"14989694","pb":"14:42.63","sb":"14:42.63","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Maureen","lastName":"Koster","id":"14372338","pb":"14:47.52","sb":"14:47.52","nat":"NED","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Elise","lastName":"Cranny","id":"14531083","pb":"14:48.02","sb":"14:52.66","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Winnie","lastName":"Jemutai","id":"14989664","pb":"14:56.99","sb":"14:56.99","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jessica","lastName":"Warner-Judd","id":"14336301","pb":"14:57.19","sb":"15:04.01","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Edinah","lastName":"Jebitok","id":"14798230","pb":"15:01.97","sb":"15:01.97","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Caroline","lastName":"Nyaga","id":"14814043","pb":"15:05.34","sb":"15:20.01","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":false},{"firstName":"Camilla","lastName":"Richardsson","id":"14379678","pb":"15:11.63","sb":"15:11.63","nat":"FIN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Aimee","lastName":"Pratt","id":"14527315","pb":"15:29.54","sb":"15:31.18","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ayal","lastName":"Dagnachew","id":"14910907","pb":null,"sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lorena","lastName":"Martín","id":"14516195","pb":null,"sb":null,"nat":"ESP","hasAvy":true}]},"400m Men":{"date":"2023-09-08T21:53","blurb":"Predicted finish:\n\n1.
