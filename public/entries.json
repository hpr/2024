{"rabat23":{"400m Hurdles Women":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:04","blurb":"Predicted Finishing Order and Times:\n\n1. Dalilah Muhammad (USA): 51.90 \n2. Shamier Little (USA): 52.35 \n3. Rushell Clayton (JAM): 52.80 \n4. Janieve Russell (JAM): 53.10 \n5. Anna Ryzhykova (UKR): 53.45 \n6. Gianna Woodruff (PAN): 53.75 \n7. Shiann Salmon (JAM): 54.20 \n8. Noura Ennadi (MAR): 56.70 \n\nReasoning: \n\n1. **Dalilah Muhammad** is expected to emerge victorious in this race, given her strong record and exceptional Personal Best (PB). Despite a lack of results in 400m Hurdles this year, she's shown competitive form in various indoor events. Her 200m and 300m results hint at good speed, while her 4x400m relay performances show good endurance. Muhammad's high experience level and world-record pedigree should not be underestimated.\n\n2. **Shamier Little** has been consistently performing well throughout the season, with a string of 1st and 2nd place finishes. Her strong 400m and 600m indoor results indicate she has the speed and endurance required for the 400m hurdles, though her DNF in the 800m raises some questions about her fitness.\n\n3. **Rushell Clayton** has also been showing good form, already running close to her personal best this year in the 400m Hurdles. She's been consistently in the top places in her races and should provide stiff competition to the top two.\n\n4. **Janieve Russell** may struggle to overcome the top three, despite having a strong PB. Her inconsistent performances this season, finishing 3rd, 5th, and 2nd in her 400m races, show a certain lack of form.\n\n5. **Anna Ryzhykova**'s results indicate a good level of fitness and speed, but her lack of recent hurdles-specific training could hinder her performance.\n\n6. **Gianna Woodruff** has not hit her stride this season, running several seconds off her personal best in the 400m Hurdles. Unless she finds significant improvement, it's unlikely she'll finish higher.\n\n7. **Shiann Salmon**, while young and promising, has had mixed results in her 400m and 400m hurdles races. Her times are somewhat off the pace set by the top runners in this race, which suggests she might struggle against this field.\n\n8. **Noura Ennadi** is relatively inexperienced and her PB is significantly slower than the other competitors. Running on home soil may provide a boost, but she's still likely to finish at the back of the pack.\n\nUltimately, this is going to be a race between Muhammad and Little. Both have demonstrated the speed and endurance necessary for a 400m hurdles race, but Muhammad's experience and previous record-breaking performances give her the edge. That said, as always in athletics, anything can happen on the day, and a single stumble or poor hurdle clearance could drastically alter the outcome.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Dalilah","lastName":"Muhammad","id":"14317560","pb":"51.58","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shamier","lastName":"Little","id":"14443767","pb":"52.39","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Anna","lastName":"Ryzhykova","id":"14304336","pb":"52.96","sb":null,"nat":"UKR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Janieve","lastName":"Russell","id":"14334022","pb":"53.08","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Rushell","lastName":"Clayton","id":"14425208","pb":"53.33","sb":"54.41","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Gianna","lastName":"Woodruff","id":"14423522","pb":"53.69","sb":"56.62","nat":"PAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shiann","lastName":"Salmon","id":"14574022","pb":"53.82","sb":"55.83","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Noura","lastName":"Ennadi","id":"14793929","pb":"56.45","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true}]},"800m Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:15","blurb":"The 800m race at the Rabat Diamond League track meet promises to be a thrilling event with a host of accomplished runners. However, predicting the exact order and times can be quite tricky given the uncertainty and variability in athletic performances. Nevertheless, here's my projected final placements based on the data available:\n\n1. Emmanuel Kipkurui Korir (KEN) - 1:43.18\n2. Wyclife Kinyamal (KEN) - 1:43.45\n3. Emmanuel Wanyonyi (KEN) - 1:43.50\n4. Marco Arop (CAN) - 1:43.60\n5. Moad Zahafi (MAR) - 1:45.25\n6. Benjamin Robert (FRA) - 1:45.40\n7. Tony van Diepen (NED) - 1:45.80\n8. Slimane Moula (ALG) - 1:46.15\n9. Abdelati el Guesse (MAR) - 1:46.50\n10. Patryk Sieradzki (POL) - 1:46.75\n\nKorir's performance towards the end of 2022 showed consistency and great potential, as evidenced by his impressive performances at Hayward Field, Stadion Śląski, and Letzigrund. However, his lack of participation this season in the 800m might indicate a slightly slower time.\n\nWyclife Kinyamal is a serious contender for the top spot, with his recent performance of 1:43.66. His times have been consistent, but Korir's experience and past achievements give him a slight edge.\n\nWanyonyi, the youngest contender, is a wild card with great potential. His recent time of 1:43.32 is quite impressive, however, his relative lack of experience in high-level international meets like the Diamond League might work against him.\n\nMarco Arop, despite having no recent performance in the 800m, had a promising 2022 season, and his personal best is quite competitive. However, his DNF earlier in the year is a cause for concern.\n\nZahafi's personal best is promising, but his recent performance isn't as impressive. Similarly, Benjamin Robert is a strong indoor athlete, but it remains to be seen how he translates this form to outdoor events.\n\nTony van Diepen and Slimane Moula have shown potential in 2023, but their personal bests fall short of the Kenyan athletes. Abdelati el Guesse, despite his age, shows potential, but a recent DNF could indicate issues.\n\nPatryk Sieradzki, although a strong contender, has had a few DNFs this year, which could indicate potential issues with consistency or injury, thus placing him at the bottom of the rankings.\n\nOf course, these are only predictions. The beauty of track and field is its unpredictability, and any athlete could potentially have a breakthrough performance.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Emmanuel Kipkurui","lastName":"Korir","id":"14755084","pb":"1:42.05","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wyclife","lastName":"Kinyamal","id":"14746603","pb":"1:43.12","sb":"1:43.66","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Marco","lastName":"Arop","id":"14755875","pb":"1:43.26","sb":null,"nat":"CAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Emmanuel","lastName":"Wanyonyi","id":"14974928","pb":"1:43.32","sb":"1:43.32","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Moad","lastName":"Zahafi","id":"14707135","pb":"1:43.69","sb":"1:48.17","nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Robert","id":"14683828","pb":"1:43.75","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tony","lastName":"van Diepen","id":"14534783","pb":"1:44.14","sb":null,"nat":"NED","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Slimane","lastName":"Moula","id":"14747495","pb":"1:44.19","sb":"1:46.06","nat":"ALG","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Abdelati","lastName":"el Guesse","id":"14652586","pb":"1:44.84","sb":"1:47.00","nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Sieradzki","id":"14647295","pb":"1:45.13","sb":null,"nat":"POL","hasAvy":false}]},"1500m Women":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:38","blurb":"**Predicted finish and times:**\n\n1. Gudaf Tsegay (ETH) - 3:55.50\n2. Freweyni Hailu (ETH) - 3:56.80\n3. Elise Cranny (USA) - 3:58.10\n4. Birke Haylom (ETH) - 4:00.50\n5. Lemlem Hailu (ETH) - 4:01.20\n6.

Zoya Naumov (ESP) - 4:10.50\n\n**Race Prediction and Preview:**\n\nStarting from the top, Gudaf Tsegay's indoor season has been nothing short of spectacular, with her finishing first in all of her events. Her previous indoor performance shows her high level of preparation for the outdoor season. Her personal best is also the fastest in the field, giving her an edge over her competitors.\n\nFreweyni Hailu, the other Ethiopian in the field, has a strong chance of taking second place. Her performances this year, especially her 3rd place finish in Doha, show she's in good form and has been competitive at a high level. Although she hasn't managed to beat Tsegay so far, she's shown promise and could certainly challenge for top spot.\n\nElise Cranny of the USA, the third predicted finisher, has shown good form recently, winning the 1500m in Azusa. Her personal best is close to Tsegay's, suggesting she could push the front runners, but she'll need a significant improvement on her season's best to make the podium.\n\nBirke Haylom, the young talent from Ethiopia, had an impressive performance in Doha, with a season's best that was also a personal best. She will likely face a tough race against more seasoned competitors but should not be underestimated. \n\nLemlem Hailu, despite a disappointing result in Doha, has shown promise this year with strong performances in the 3000m indoor. Her personal best is close to Haylom's, so she could challenge for a higher position with a good race.\n\nClaudia Mihaela Bobocea, despite having an older personal best, had solid indoor performances this year and will be expected to maintain her form in Rabat. Linden Hall's performance has been slightly inconsistent this season, but she still has the experience and personal best time to secure a middle-place finish.\n\nCory Ann McGee has had a challenging season so far with multiple DNFs and a 10th place finish in Doha. She'll need a substantial improvement on her season's best to challenge the leading group. \n\nCharlotte Mouchet and Zoya Naumov, despite their best efforts, seem to lack the personal best times to challenge for a higher finish. They'll be looking to use this event to improve their own times and gain experience at this high level of competition.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Gudaf","lastName":"Tsegay","id":"14595214","pb":"3:54.01","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Freweyni","lastName":"Hailu","id":"14836656","pb":"3:56.28","sb":"4:00.29","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Linden","lastName":"Hall","id":"14272002","pb":"3:59.01","sb":"4:05.65","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Elise","lastName":"Cranny","id":"14531083","pb":"3:59.06","sb":"4:07.07","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lemlem","lastName":"Hailu","id":"14806061","pb":"4:00.32","sb":"4:08.38","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Cory Ann","lastName":"McGee","id":"14316538","pb":"4:00.34","sb":"4:06.03","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Claudia Mihaela","lastName":"Bobocea","id":"14377909","pb":"4:01.10","sb":null,"nat":"ROU","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Birke","lastName":"Haylom","id":"15009582","pb":"4:01.86","sb":"4:01.86","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Charlotte","lastName":"Mouchet","id":"14534796","pb":"4:09.47","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Zoya","lastName":"Naumov","id":"14477412","pb":"4:13.66","sb":"4:13.66","nat":"ESP","hasAvy":true,"team":"Monmouth University Hawks"}]},"400m Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T19:52","blurb":"Predicted Final Places and Times:\n\n1. Steven Gardiner (BAH) - 43.62\n2. Vernon Norwood (USA) - 44.58\n3. Bayapo Ndori (BOT) - 44.64\n4. Rusheen McDonald (JAM) - 44.78\n5. Matthew Hudson-Smith (GBR) - 45.12\n6. Zakhiti Nene (RSA) - 45.37\n7. Ricky Petrucciani (SUI) - 45.82\n8. Hamza Dair (MAR) - 46.24\n\nExplanation:\n\nSteven Gardiner, with the best personal best (43.48), takes my pick for first place. His shorter distance results this season suggest he is in good form, and even though he has not run a 400m race yet this season, his excellent performances in 300m and 200m races show he's maintaining speed and strength.\n\nVernon Norwood's season has been quite impressive. His season's best (44.68) is the best among all competitors and his consistent performances at both 200m and 400m suggest he is in good form. Given his experience at the age of 31, I expect him to deliver a strong performance and secure second place.\n\nBayapo Ndori is an interesting contender. His personal best is not far off from Vernon Norwood, and his season's best equals Norwood's. Despite a dip in his most recent 400m race, he has the youth and the potential to bounce back for a strong finish.\n\nRusheen McDonald, while experienced, has been inconsistent this season with times ranging from mid 45s to high 46s in the 400m. His season's best is decent but considering his recent performances, it seems more likely he will fall short of his personal best.\n\nMatthew Hudson-Smith, even though he has a good personal best, his recent times are slower and he has not been consistent this season. His failed attempts at the 400m and the relay race in April suggest he might be struggling with form or fitness.\n\nZakhiti Nene has a good personal best but his season's best is quite far off from it. His recent times have been inconsistent, oscillating in the mid to high 45s. He would need a major improvement to compete with the top finishers.\n\nRicky Petrucciani's personal best is decent, but without any 400m outdoor races in 2023, it's tough to gauge his form. His indoor performances, while solid, are not enough to predict a strong finish in this competitive field.\n\nFinally, Hamza Dair, the youngest competitor, doesn't have a great personal or season's best. His disqualification in the indoor 400m in January and lack of 400m races this season does not inspire confidence in a strong performance.\n\nIn summary, this race is likely to be dominated by the more experienced athletes with proven track records, with Gardiner and Norwood leading the way. The younger athletes such as Ndori and Dair have potential, but they'll need to surpass their personal bests to stand a chance against these seasoned competitors.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Steven","lastName":"Gardiner","id":"14578505","pb":"43.48","sb":null,"nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Rusheen","lastName":"McDonald","id":"14468667","pb":"43.93","sb":"45.26","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Hudson-Smith","id":"14407278","pb":"44.35","sb":"45.28","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Vernon","lastName":"Norwood","id":"14490237","pb":"44.35","sb":"44.68","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Bayapo","lastName":"Ndori","id":"14847443","pb":"44.61","sb":"44.61","nat":"BOT","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Zakhiti","lastName":"Nene","id":"14696997","pb":"44.74","sb":"45.47","nat":"RSA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ricky","lastName":"Petrucciani","id":"14742772","pb":"45.02","sb":null,"nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hamza","lastName":"Dair","id":"14843148","pb":"45.65","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true}]},"1500m Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T20:11","blurb":"**Race Prediction:**\n\n1.

Julian Ranc (FRA) - 3:39.20\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nJakob Ingebrigtsen, the young sensation from Norway, is expected to continue his dominant run and take the top spot, improving on his best time of the season. His recent form, especially in indoor 1500m events, has been remarkable and he's the clear favorite heading into the meet.\n\nAbel Kipsang, who's had an impressive start to the season with a solid 1500m time, is predicted to be hot on Ingebrigtsen's heels, securing second place. Kipsang's strong finish in the Kenyan meet suggests that he is in good form and should perform well.\n\nThe third spot might see a bit of an upset with Yared Nuguse from the USA pipping some more experienced competitors. Nuguse has been performing exceptionally well in the 1500m this season and his recent first place in 800m indicates good form and speed. \n\nOliver Hoare and Mario García are predicted to take the fourth and fifth places respectively. Both have demonstrated good form recently but will need to up their game to compete with the likes of Ingebrigtsen and Kipsang.\n\nFilip Ingebrigtsen, Jakob's older brother, could find it tough to compete against his younger sibling and the other young talents. While he has a solid personal best, his recent form has been inconsistent with several DNFs in 2022.\n\nCharles Cheboi Simotwo, Michał Rozmys, and Ismael Debjani are all experienced runners who should put up solid performances, but they may struggle to break into the top ranks given the fierce competition.\n\nThe remaining athletes, Abdellatif Sadiki, Hicham Akankam, Elhassane Moujahid, Hafid Rizqy, and Julian Ranc, will likely find it tough to compete against the more established names in the field.

The 2023 season has already been incredibly strong for Kerley, and his momentum seems unstoppable at this point. With impressive results and a season best time of 9.88, it's safe to say he has been in excellent form. \n\nFerdinand Omanyala comes in a close second. His current season's best is just a fraction behind Kerley's, and he's been showing exceptional form as well, but Kerley's consistency might just edge him out. \n\nThird place goes to Trayvon Bromell. His indoor performances this season have been strong, showing his speed and form, even if his outdoor 100m times have yet to be seen. \n\nAkani Simbine and Lamont Marcell Jacobs are expected to follow in fourth and fifth place, respectively. Both have been performing well in 2023, but the high level of competition in this event makes a top-three finish challenging. \n\nAndre de Grasse is predicted to finish sixth. His 2023 season hasn't been as strong as his competitors, so he might struggle to make the top three. \n\nYohan Blake is predicted to finish seventh. He has had a legendary career but is the oldest in this group. His recent performances suggest that he may not be at the peak of his abilities anymore.\n\nLetsile Tebogo, despite being the youngest, has shown he's a strong competitor. However, the lack of a posted 100m time in 2023 makes it difficult to place him higher.\n\nFinally, Chakir MacHmour, despite showing significant improvement and a winning streak in his home country, lacks the personal best times to compete with the rest of the field, placing him in ninth.\n\nThese predictions take into account recent form, personal best times, and this season's best times.

She has the potential to challenge Moraa for the top spot but will likely finish a close second.\n\nDespite the lack of an 800m race this season, Natoya Goule's experience and strong performances over shorter distances indicate she will be in contention. The veteran athlete from Jamaica may finish third, just behind Bisset.\n\nSage Hurta-Klecker from the USA has displayed solid performances across various distances. However, her lack of an 800m race this season may hinder her chances, resulting in a fourth-place finish.\n\nRaevyn Rogers, also from the USA, will likely come in fifth. Despite her personal best, her recent performance in the 800m has been less impressive.\n\nAnita Horvat has demonstrated strong form in her indoor 800m races, and should finish in the middle of the pack. Hoffmann, despite her excellent indoor performances, may struggle with the transition to outdoor competition. Yarigo, despite her experience, will likely find it difficult to compete against younger athletes with faster recent times.\n\nAs for the remaining athletes, Raziki, Hajji, and Wyciszkiewicz-Zawadzka, they have shown less competitive times this season and will likely round out the final positions. Their times suggest that they'll be competitive, but a top-three finish would be a surprise.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Natoya","lastName":"Goule","id":"14285696","pb":"1:56.15","sb":null,"nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mary","lastName":"Moraa","id":"14798209","pb":"1:56.71","sb":"1:58.83","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Raevyn","lastName":"Rogers","id":"14378260","pb":"1:56.81","sb":"2:03.53","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Sage","lastName":"Hurta-Klecker","id":"14478094","pb":"1:57.85","sb":null,"nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Catriona","lastName":"Bisset","id":"14463325","pb":"1:58.09","sb":"1:58.32","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lore","lastName":"Hoffmann","id":"14457538","pb":"1:58.50","sb":"2:06.68","nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Anita","lastName":"Horvat","id":"14472475","pb":"1:58.96","sb":null,"nat":"SLO","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Noélie","lastName":"Yarigo","id":"14270067","pb":"1:59.12","sb":null,"nat":"BEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Assia","lastName":"Raziki","id":"14548932","pb":"2:01.44","sb":"2:04.52","nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Soukaina","lastName":"Hajji","id":"14579514","pb":"2:01.59","sb":"2:04.05","nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Patrycja","lastName":"Wyciszkiewicz-Zawadzka","id":"14389670","pb":null,"sb":null,"nat":"POL","hasAvy":true}]},"3000m Steeplechase Men":{"date":"2023-05-28T20:46","blurb":"**Men's 3000m Steeplechase - 2023 Rabat Diamond League - Predicted Finishing Order & Times**\n\n1.

After finishing fourth in Doha earlier this month, he will be aiming to improve his performance and is the man to beat in this race.\n\nKipruto, with a personal best just shy of the 8-minute mark at 8:00.12, was a dominant force in 2022, consistently finishing within the top five. However, his times have been inconsistent, suggesting he may be past his peak. \n\nKigen and Kibiwot, both from Kenya, and Ethiopia's Wale are likely to be pushing for the top spots. Kigen has had a mixed season but his personal best time of 8:05.12 shows his potential. Wale, the youngest in the field at 22, may be the dark horse of the competition with his 8:05.21 personal best.\n\nMeanwhile, Bedrani (FRA) and Bor (USA) will lead the charge for the non-African contingent. Bedrani, in particular, has shown promise with a personal best of 8:05.23.\n\nOverall, the Rabat Diamond League 3000m Steeplechase is set to be a highly competitive race filled with thrilling moments and possibly unexpected results. All eyes will certainly be on the home favourite, El Bakkali, to see if he can seize the top spot.\n","entrants":[{"firstName":"Soufiane","lastName":"el Bakkali","id":"14590424","pb":"7:58.15","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Conseslus","lastName":"Kipruto","id":"14479159","pb":"8:00.12","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Benjamin","lastName":"Kigen","id":"14590800","pb":"8:05.12","sb":"8:30.81","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Getnet","lastName":"Wale","id":"14760253","pb":"8:05.21","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Djilali","lastName":"Bedrani","id":"14423830","pb":"8:05.23","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Abraham","lastName":"Kibiwot","id":"14657344","pb":"8:05.72","sb":"8:19.71","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hailemariyam","lastName":"Amare","id":"14657460","pb":"8:06.29","sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hillary","lastName":"Bor","id":"14232976","pb":"8:08.41","sb":"8:20.67","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Leonard Kipkemoi","lastName":"Bett","id":"14802643","pb":"8:08.61","sb":"8:20.02","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Amos","lastName":"Serem","id":"14808796","pb":"8:09.93","sb":"8:25.61","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Osama","lastName":"Zoghlami","id":"14530462","pb":"8:11.00","sb":null,"nat":"ITA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Avinash Mukund","lastName":"Sable","id":"14778911","pb":"8:11.20","sb":null,"nat":"IND","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Tindouft","id":"14773269","pb":"8:11.65","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mehdi","lastName":"Belhadj","id":"14549862","pb":"8:12.43","sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mohamed Amin","lastName":"Jhinaoui","id":"14735778","pb":"8:16.38","sb":null,"nat":"TUN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Salaheddine","lastName":"ben Yazide","id":"14977838","pb":"8:19.63","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wilberforce Chemiat","lastName":"Kones","id":"14755096","pb":"8:21.42","sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":false},{"firstName":"Abderrafia","lastName":"Bouassel","id":"14843153","pb":"8:27.00","sb":null,"nat":"MAR","hasAvy":false}]}}}
