He is a consistent performer, and he is capable of running a fast time on a good day.\n\nThe Boston Marathon is a challenging course, but Desisa has the experience and the fitness to run well on it. He will be looking to challenge for a podium finish, and he could even be in contention for the win if the conditions are right.\n\nHere is a possible race strategy for Desisa:\n\n* Start conservatively in the first half of the race.\n* Aim to run a negative split in the second half of the race.\n* Make a move for the lead in the final miles of the race.\n\nDesisa will need to be patient in the early stages of the race. He should not get caught up in the excitement of the race and start too fast. He should focus on running his own race and conserving his energy.\n\nIn the second half of the race, Desisa can start to make his move. He should try to run a negative split, which means running the second half of the race faster than the first half. This will help him to close the gap on the leaders and potentially make a move for the win.\n\nIn the final miles of the race, Desisa can make his final push for the win. He should try to run as fast as he can and see if he can catch the leaders. If he is able to do so, he will be in contention for the win.\n\nDesisa is a strong contender for the 2023 Boston Marathon. He has the talent, the experience, and the fitness to run a fast time on the challenging course. He will be looking to challenge for a podium finish, and he could even be in contention for the win if the conditions are right.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Desisa has not raced since 2020, when he finished second at the London Marathon. It is unclear how he will perform after such a long layoff. He will need to be in good shape to challenge for the win in Boston.\n\nIn addition, Desisa has not won a marathon since 2015. He has been runner-up three times since then, including at the 2018 and 2020 Boston Marathons. It is unclear if he has the same level of motivation and focus that he had when he was winning marathons.\n\nOverall, Desisa is a talented runner with a strong track record. However, he has some question marks heading into the 2023 Boston Marathon. He will need to be in good shape and have a good race strategy if he wants to challenge for the win."
