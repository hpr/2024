{"zurich23":{"400m Hurdles Men":{"date":"2023-08-31T20:04","blurb":"Predicted finish and times:\n\n1. Karsten Warholm (NOR) - 46.35\n2. Rai Benjamin (USA) - 46.55\n3. Alison dos Santos (BRA) - 47.00\n4. CJ Allen (USA) - 47.60\n5. Roshawn Clarke (JAM) - 47.75\n6. Kyron McMaster (IVB) - 48.20\n7. Trevor Bassitt (USA) - 48.45\n8. Wilfried Happio (FRA) - 48.70\n\nPreview and Prediction:\n\nTaking a closer look at each athlete's performances, it becomes clear that the race for the gold medal is likely to be a tight one between Karsten Warholm and Rai Benjamin. Warholm, the 26-year-old Norwegian, has been in exceptional form throughout the year, consistently finishing in the top spot with impressive times. His consistency and experience give him the slight edge over Benjamin.\n\nHowever, Rai Benjamin's performances cannot be overlooked. The 25-year-old American has shown his potential with a 44.21 second finish in the 400m race in Los Angeles, the fastest 400m time among all competitors. Though his hurdle times are slightly slower than Warholm's, if he can translate his flat speed to the hurdles, he could potentially take the top spot.\n\nBrazil's Alison dos Santos is predicted to take the bronze. The 22-year-old has consistently finished in top positions in his races, indicating his capability to compete with the more experienced athletes. His second-place finish in Monaco with a time of 47.66 seconds shows that he can challenge for the podium.\n\nCJ Allen, another American competitor, has shown consistent performances, especially his 47.91 second finish in Los Angeles and 47.58 second finish in Oslo. He's likely to be in the mix for the top spots, but the fierce competition might just edge him out of the podium.\n\nRoshawn Clarke, the youngest competitor at 18 years old, has shown immense potential with his times. However, his lack of experience in high-stakes races might be a disadvantage. Kyron McMaster's inconsistent performances, including a DNF, put him further down the list.\n\nTrevor Bassitt and Wilfried Happio, despite their best efforts, are predicted to trail in the race. Bassitt's times have been inconsistent, and Happio's peak performance time is lower than most of his competitors.\n\nAll in all, this race is set to be a thrilling one, with top athletes Warholm and Benjamin likely to battle it out for the gold. However, the unpredictable nature of the 400m hurdles means any slip-up could drastically change the outcome.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Karsten","lastName":"Warholm","id":"14479487","pb":"45.94","sb":"46.51","nat":"NOR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Rai","lastName":"Benjamin","id":"14574865","pb":"46.17","sb":"46.62","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Alison","lastName":"dos Santos","id":"14755064","pb":"46.29","sb":"47.38","nat":"BRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Kyron","lastName":"McMaster","id":"14532760","pb":"47.08","sb":"47.26","nat":"IVB","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Roshawn","lastName":"Clarke","id":"14931525","pb":"47.34","sb":"47.34","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Trevor","lastName":"Bassitt","id":"14719193","pb":"47.38","sb":"47.38","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Wilfried","lastName":"Happio","id":"14650750","pb":"47.41","sb":"48.13","nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"CJ","lastName":"Allen","id":"14627624","pb":"47.58","sb":"47.58","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true,"team":"WSU Cougars"}]},"100m Women":{"date":"2023-08-31T20:15","blurb":"Predicted Finish and Marks:\n\n1.

She dominated the field throughout the year, consistently running below 10.80, with a personal best of 10.57. She has been dominant against this field and consistently delivers under pressure.\n\nElaine Thompson-Herah is a strong contender for the second spot. Her experience and consistent performance in the 100 metres, with times regularly below 11.20, coupled with her outstanding relay performance, makes her a strong contender.\n\nShashalee Forbes is predicted to come third, her performance at the Budapest Championships with a timing of 11.12, shows she has the ability to compete at the highest level.\n\nTwanisha Terry and Daryll Neita are expected to be in the middle of the pack. Both have shown consistent performances throughout the season but have not been able to break the 10.90 barrier consistently. Terry's best time of 10.86 came with a wind assistance of +2.5, which is higher than the allowable limit for record purposes.\n\nZoe Hobbs has shown significant improvement over the season and could be a dark horse in the race. Her time of 10.96 in La Chaux-de-Fonds shows her potential.\n\nMujinga Kambundji, Ewa Swoboda, Tamara Clark, and Natasha Morrison are expected to round out the field. While all of these athletes have had impressive performances this year, they have not been as consistent as the top contenders and have not broken the 11-second barrier in major championships.\n\nThis race prediction is based on recent performances, but as with any race, anything can happen on the day. The athletes' form, mental readiness, and reaction to the pressure of the championship will all play a part in the final outcome.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Elaine","lastName":"Thompson-Herah","id":"14285956","pb":"10.54","sb":"11.06","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Sha'Carri","lastName":"Richardson","id":"14717691","pb":"10.65","sb":"10.65","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Twanisha","lastName":"Terry","id":"14553598","pb":"10.82","sb":"10.99","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Natasha","lastName":"Morrison","id":"14285826","pb":"10.87","sb":"10.98","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Clark","id":"14596381","pb":"10.88","sb":"10.98","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mujinga","lastName":"Kambundji","id":"14300897","pb":"10.89","sb":"11.04","nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Daryll","lastName":"Neita","id":"14476603","pb":"10.90","sb":"10.96","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ewa","lastName":"Swoboda","id":"14451085","pb":"10.94","sb":"10.94","nat":"POL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Shashalee","lastName":"Forbes","id":"14574709","pb":"10.96","sb":"10.96","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Zoe","lastName":"Hobbs","id":"14499691","pb":"10.96","sb":"10.96","nat":"NZL","hasAvy":true}]},"3000m Steeplechase Women":{"date":"2023-08-31T20:23","blurb":"Predicted Finish:\n\n1.

She has shown a consistent improvement and seems to be in top form.\n\nWinfred Mutile Yavi comes in a close second as her recent performances, particularly her first-place finish in Algiers, show her competitive edge in the 3000m steeplechase event.\n\nZerfe Wondemagegn's consistent performances, such as her third-place finish in Firenze, indicate her ability to perform well in the championships, placing her at third.\n\nBeatrice Chepkoech has had a strong season with several first-place finishes, however, her recent performances have shown a slight decline, hence she is predicted to finish fourth.\n\nFaith Cherotich, despite being the youngest contender, has shown impressive performances, especially her third-place finish in Nairobi. Nevertheless, her lack of experience might place her fifth.\n\nMaruša Mišmaš Zrimšek's recent performances have been slightly inconsistent, but her overall record indicates her ability to secure a sixth-place finish.\n\nCourtney Wayment has shown a consistent upward trend in her recent performances, and considering her fourth-place finish in London, she is predicted to finish seventh.\n\nLuiza Gega, Marwa Bouzayani, Alice Finot, Mekides Abebe, and Peruth Chemutai have shown relatively inconsistent performances recently, leading to their lower rankings. However, they remain strong competitors within the event.\n\nIn the end, this is just a prediction and the actual results could vary based on the athletes' conditions on the day of the race and other unpredictable factors.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Beatrice","lastName":"Chepkoech","id":"14383286","pb":"8:44.32","sb":"8:58.98","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Winfred Mutile","lastName":"Yavi","id":"14695622","pb":"8:54.29","sb":"8:54.29","nat":"BRN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mekides","lastName":"Abebe","id":"14804561","pb":"8:56.08","sb":"9:11.09","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jackline","lastName":"Chepkoech","id":"14989892","pb":"8:57.35","sb":"8:57.35","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Faith","lastName":"Cherotich","id":"14989893","pb":"9:00.69","sb":"9:00.69","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Peruth","lastName":"Chemutai","id":"14707661","pb":"9:01.45","sb":"9:10.26","nat":"UGA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Zerfe","lastName":"Wondemagegn","id":"14894854","pb":"9:04.61","sb":"9:04.61","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Alice","lastName":"Finot","id":"14758606","pb":"9:06.15","sb":"9:06.15","nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Maruša","lastName":"Mišmaš Zrimšek","id":"14375060","pb":"9:06.37","sb":"9:06.37","nat":"SLO","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Courtney","lastName":"Wayment","id":"14617090","pb":"9:09.91","sb":"9:11.41","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Luiza","lastName":"Gega","id":"14272917","pb":"9:10.04","sb":"9:10.27","nat":"ALB","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Marwa","lastName":"Bouzayani","id":"14595096","pb":"9:11.76","sb":"9:11.76","nat":"TUN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Lomi","lastName":"Muleta","id":"14893973","pb":"9:14.03","sb":"9:15.35","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Aimee","lastName":"Pratt","id":"14527315","pb":"9:15.64","sb":"9:16.10","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Olivia","lastName":"Gürth","id":"14804796","pb":"9:20.08","sb":"9:20.08","nat":"GER","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Fancy","lastName":"Cherono","id":"14798265","pb":"9:27.30","sb":"9:32.93","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true}]},"1500m Men":{"date":"2023-08-31T20:41","blurb":"Predicted Finish: \n\n1.

Nuguse edges out the victory due to his stellar performances in 2023, consistently finishing in the top 3 and maintaining a faster average time compared to Katir. His recent 1st place finish at the Olympic Stadium, London, with a time of 3:30.44, indicates he is in top form.\n\nKatir, though very competitive, has had a few less-than-stellar performances in recent races which nudges him to the 2nd spot. However, his victory in Torrent, Spain, with a time of 3:46.40, shows he is not to be underestimated.\n\nAbel Kipsang is predicted to take the 3rd spot, with his strong performances in Kenya. Reynold Kipkorir Cheruiyot, the youngest competitor, impresses with a predicted 4th place finish, thanks to his exceptional performances at such a young age.\n\nNarve Gilje Nordås and Neil Gourley are predicted to follow closely behind. Nordås has shown remarkable consistency, with a recent 3rd place finish in Budapest, while Gourley has shown his potential with a 3rd place finish in London.\n\nAndrew Coscoran and Azeddine Habz are predicted to finish in the middle of the pack. Both have shown potential but have also had inconsistent performances throughout the year.\n\nCole Hocker, despite his youth, is expected to hold his own against the more experienced competitors. Mario García, Josh Kerr, and Stewart McSweyn, though competent competitors, have had less consistent performances, which places them towards the end of the predicted finish.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Mohamed","lastName":"Katir","id":"14642046","pb":"3:28.76","sb":"3:28.89","nat":"ESP","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Yared","lastName":"Nuguse","id":"14798735","pb":"3:29.02","sb":"3:29.02","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Josh","lastName":"Kerr","id":"14533464","pb":"3:29.05","sb":"3:29.38","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Abel","lastName":"Kipsang","id":"14909437","pb":"3:29.11","sb":"3:29.11","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mario","lastName":"García","id":"14691570","pb":"3:29.18","sb":"3:29.18","nat":"ESP","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Azeddine","lastName":"Habz","id":"14640588","pb":"3:29.26","sb":"3:29.26","nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Narve Gilje","lastName":"Nordås","id":"14705412","pb":"3:29.47","sb":"3:29.47","nat":"NOR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Stewart","lastName":"McSweyn","id":"14500488","pb":"3:29.51","sb":"3:31.42","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Reynold Kipkorir","lastName":"Cheruiyot","id":"14997479","pb":"3:30.30","sb":"3:30.30","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Andrew","lastName":"Coscoran","id":"14595170","pb":"3:30.42","sb":"3:30.42","nat":"IRL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Neil","lastName":"Gourley","id":"14513077","pb":"3:30.60","sb":"3:30.60","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Cole","lastName":"Hocker","id":"14905834","pb":"3:30.70","sb":"3:30.70","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Samuel","lastName":"Tanner","id":"14785591","pb":"3:31.24","sb":"3:31.24","nat":"NZL","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Niels","lastName":"Laros","id":"14910035","pb":"3:31.25","sb":"3:31.25","nat":"NED","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Matthew","lastName":"Ramsden","id":"14576384","pb":"3:34.08","sb":"3:35.52","nat":"AUS","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tom","lastName":"Elmer","id":"14532342","pb":"3:34.50","sb":"3:34.50","nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Patryk","lastName":"Sieradzki","id":"14647295","pb":"3:58.04","sb":null,"nat":"POL","hasAvy":true}]},"800m Women":{"date":"2023-08-31T20:53","blurb":"Predicted Finish and Marks:\n\n1.

Her time of 22.05 in July indicates she could potentially break into the 21-second range, earning her a place on the podium.\n\nDaryll Neita's consistent performance in both 100 and 200 metres races makes her a strong contender.

Twanisha Terry, while a solid performer, has not shown the same level of form as the top contenders and is likely to finish towards the bottom. \n\nFinally, Tamara Clark, despite her youth and potential, has not shown consistent enough form in the 200 metres to suggest she will challenge for a top position. Her times have varied significantly from 22.02 to 22.83, suggesting a lack of consistency in her performance.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Shericka","lastName":"Jackson","id":"14325599","pb":"21.41","sb":"21.41","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Gabrielle","lastName":"Thomas","id":"14733520","pb":"21.60","sb":"21.60","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tamara","lastName":"Clark","id":"14596381","pb":"21.92","sb":"22.02","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Brittany","lastName":"Brown","id":"14437218","pb":"21.99","sb":"22.05","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Kayla","lastName":"White","id":"14642681","pb":"22.01","sb":"22.01","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true,"team":"North Carolina A&T Aggies"},{"firstName":"Anthonique","lastName":"Strachan","id":"14368117","pb":"22.15","sb":"22.15","nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Daryll","lastName":"Neita","id":"14476603","pb":"22.16","sb":"22.16","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Twanisha","lastName":"Terry","id":"14553598","pb":"22.17","sb":"22.17","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true}]},"5000m Men":{"date":"2023-08-31T21:10","blurb":"Predicted Finish and Marks:\n\n1.

His most recent win in Monaco with a time of 12:42.18 shows he cannot be ruled out. Despite his age, he has consistently performed well, and his experience will count in this race.\n\nJacob Krop and Grant Fisher are strong contenders for the third position. Krop's win in Nairobi and Fisher's consistent performance in various meets suggest they could be dark horses in this race. However, Krop has the edge due to his better performance in the 5000 Metres race.\n\nLuis Grijalva and William Kincaid are expected to finish in the middle of the pack. Despite Grijalva's strong performance in Firenze and Kincaid's indoor win in Boston, their recent performances have not been as strong as their fellow competitors.\n\nSelemon Barega, despite being young, has had a challenging year. His recent performances have shown a lack of consistency, which may affect his performance in this race.\n\nDominic Lokinyomo Lobalu, Yann Schrub, Jonas Raess and Andreas Almgren are expected to finish towards the end of the pack. Despite some strong individual performances, their recent race times suggest they may struggle to compete with the top runners.\n\nYoung Kuma Girma is the underdog of this race. With his age and lack of experience, he's expected to finish last, but this race could provide valuable experience for his future athletic career.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Yomif","lastName":"Kejelcha","id":"14594967","pb":"12:41.73","sb":"12:41.73","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Hagos","lastName":"Gebrhiwet","id":"14477352","pb":"12:42.18","sb":"12:42.18","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Selemon","lastName":"Barega","id":"14751317","pb":"12:43.02","sb":"12:56.18","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jacob","lastName":"Krop","id":"14808798","pb":"12:45.71","sb":"12:46.02","nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Grant","lastName":"Fisher","id":"14591210","pb":"12:46.96","sb":"12:56.99","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Dominic Lokinyomo","lastName":"Lobalu","id":"14792211","pb":"12:52.15","sb":"13:24.28","nat":"SSD","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Luis","lastName":"Grijalva","id":"14749285","pb":"12:52.97","sb":"12:52.97","nat":"GUA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Kincaid","id":"14493258","pb":"12:54.40","sb":"12:54.40","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Andreas","lastName":"Almgren","id":"14460738","pb":"13:01.70","sb":"13:25.70","nat":"SWE","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Kuma","lastName":"Girma","id":"14975226","pb":"13:03.37","sb":"13:03.37","nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Yann","lastName":"Schrub","id":"14528844","pb":"13:11.44","sb":"13:11.44","nat":"FRA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jonas","lastName":"Raess","id":"14427180","pb":"13:13.83","sb":"13:13.83","nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Mounir","lastName":"Akbache","id":"14182819","pb":null,"sb":null,"nat":"FRA","hasAvy":false},{"firstName":"Lamecha","lastName":"Girma","id":"14848765","pb":null,"sb":null,"nat":"ETH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Kyumbe","lastName":"Munguti","id":"14849576","pb":null,"sb":null,"nat":"KEN","hasAvy":true}]},"100m Hurdles Women":{"date":"2023-08-31T21:33","blurb":"Predicted Finish and Marks:\n\n1.

Devynne Charlton (BAH) - 12.55\n8. Ditaji Kambundji (SUI) - 12.61\n9. Pia Skrzyszowska (POL) - 12.65\n\nRace Preview:\n\nJasmine Camacho-Quinn is predicted to win this race with a time of 12.25. She has been showing consistent top finishes, including seven first-place finishes. Her time of 12.17 in Bermuda, albeit with a high wind reading, signals her readiness to run fast. \n\nKendra Harrison from the USA is predicted to come in second. Harrison has been consistent in her times, often clocking in under 12.50. However, her inconsistency in winning races, with a few second-place finishes, could hinder her from clinching the top spot.\n\nThird place is predicted to go to Nia Ali. Despite her age, Ali's performances have been strong, with a notable first-place finish in Monaco with a time of 12.30.\n\nAlaysha Johnson, another USA representative, is predicted to come in fourth. Her performances have been mixed, with impressive wins but also some lower finishes. However, her recent win in Memphis with a time of 12.49 suggests she could put up a strong performance.\n\nTia Jones is predicted to come in fifth. Her times have been consistent, but she has not been able to consistently win races against top-level competitors. \n\nDanielle Williams is predicted to land in the sixth spot. Her performance has been inconsistent, and she has struggled against top-level competitors, with several finishes outside of the top three.\n\nDevynne Charlton has shown potential but her inconsistency places her in seventh. With times often over 12.60, she might struggle against this top-level field.\n\nDitaji Kambundji is predicted to finish in the eighth spot. Despite her young age, she has shown an ability to run fast times. However, she lacks the consistency and strong finishes of her competitors.\n\nFinally, Pia Skrzyszowska is predicted to finish in ninth. Although she has a few first-place finishes, her times are consistently in the 12.60s and 12.70s, which may not be enough to compete with this field.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Kendra","lastName":"Harrison","id":"14425415","pb":"12.20","sb":"12.24","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Jasmine","lastName":"Camacho-Quinn","id":"14494234","pb":"12.26","sb":"12.31","nat":"PUR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Nia","lastName":"Ali","id":"14304647","pb":"12.30","sb":"12.30","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Danielle","lastName":"Williams","id":"14450995","pb":"12.32","sb":"12.43","nat":"JAM","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Alaysha","lastName":"Johnson","id":"14486620","pb":"12.35","sb":"12.37","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Tia","lastName":"Jones","id":"14563262","pb":"12.38","sb":"12.39","nat":"USA","hasAvy":false},{"firstName":"Devynne","lastName":"Charlton","id":"14414505","pb":"12.44","sb":"12.44","nat":"BAH","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Ditaji","lastName":"Kambundji","id":"14739461","pb":"12.47","sb":"12.47","nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Pia","lastName":"Skrzyszowska","id":"14736349","pb":"12.51","sb":"12.59","nat":"POL","hasAvy":true}]},"200m Men":{"date":"2023-08-31T21:41","blurb":"Predicted Finish and Marks:\n\n1. Noah Lyles (USA) - 19.45\n2. Erriyon Knighton (USA) - 19.55\n3. Letsile Tebogo (BOT) - 19.62\n4. Kenneth Bednarek (USA) - 19.70\n5. Zharnel Hughes (GBR) - 19.75\n6. Aaron Brown (CAN) - 19.80\n7. Andre De Grasse (CAN) - 19.85\n8. William Reais (SUI) - 20.35\n\nPreview:\n\nNoah Lyles is the favorite to win the 200 metres at the upcoming athletics championship. His recent performance of 19.47 (+1.6) in London makes him the one to beat. His consistency in maintaining top positions in most of his 100m and 200m races, along with his experience and age, gives him an edge over other competitors.\n\nErriyon Knighton, despite being the youngest in the pack, has shown remarkable performances this season. His stunning 19.72 in Eugene suggests he could push Lyles all the way. However, his relative inexperience might prevent him from clinching the top spot.\n\nLetsile Tebogo's performance in London, finishing just behind Lyles, was impressive. His 19.50 makes him a strong contender for a podium finish. However, he has been less consistent than Lyles or Knighton, which could affect his final position.\n\nKenneth Bednarek's performance has been commendable this season, with his 19.82 in Eugene being a standout. However, he hasn't consistently touched the sub-20 mark as often as the top three, which might cost him.\n\nZharnel Hughes, despite his mature age and experience, has been inconsistent this season. His best of 19.73 in London was impressive, but his performances haven't been as consistent as the American trio.\n\nAaron Brown and Andre De Grasse have been fairly consistent, but their times haven't been as impressive as the top five. Brown's 20.08 in Budapest and De Grasse's 20.01 in Langley suggest they could struggle in this high-caliber field.\n\nWilliam Reais, despite his commendable performance in Bern, is likely to struggle in this race. His best time of 20.38 is significantly slower than the rest of the field, making him the underdog for this event.","entrants":[{"firstName":"Noah","lastName":"Lyles","id":"14536762","pb":"19.31","sb":"19.47","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Erriyon","lastName":"Knighton","id":"14897541","pb":"19.49","sb":"19.72","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Letsile","lastName":"Tebogo","id":"14883897","pb":"19.50","sb":"19.50","nat":"BOT","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Andre","lastName":"de Grasse","id":"14535607","pb":"19.62","sb":"20.01","nat":"CAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Kenneth","lastName":"Bednarek","id":"14715244","pb":"19.68","sb":"19.82","nat":"USA","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Zharnel","lastName":"Hughes","id":"14414524","pb":"19.73","sb":"19.73","nat":"GBR","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"Aaron","lastName":"Brown","id":"14366482","pb":"19.95","sb":"20.00","nat":"CAN","hasAvy":true},{"firstName":"William","lastName":"Reais","id":"14740317","pb":"20.24","sb":"20.38","nat":"SUI","hasAvy":true}]}}}
